just how is hillary kerr the founder of a digital media company in los angeles she can tell you what song was playing five years ago on the jukebox at the bar where she somewhat randomly met the man who became her husband it was these days ù the version sung by nico the german made famous by andy warhol and the velvet underground actually the song had been playing just before she met jonathan leahy now 38 on that december night in 2011 at the 4100 bar in the silver lake district of los angeles ms kerr can t remember exactly what was playing when they met because at that moment she was jumping up and down like tigger ù as she put it in answering the usual questions mr leahy told her he was a music supervisor for girls ù the hbo show created by and starring lena dunham that was enough to get ms kerr bouncing your music has changed my life ù she told mr leahy mr leahy who is quiet but not shy at least he doesn t jump up and down upon meeting people was mesmerized my main reaction ù he said was it s a lot easier to talk to beautiful women in a bar when you re working on a hit show ù they exchanged email addresses more an act of politeness than promise then their soundtrack went quiet for almost a year both mr leahy and ms kerr had active social lives but they were focused on their careers mr leahy who grew up in laconia n h graduated from the college of william and mary in williamsburg va in 2000 and landed in los angeles later that year now he is a music supervisor with aperture music and is joined by manish raval and tom wolfe in being responsible for the music on girls ù the team has also worked on films including trainwreck ù and television series such as new girl ù in addition mr leahy is the music supervisor for survivor s remorse ù on starz ms kerr grew up in the la jolla section of san diego graduated from the university of southern california in 2000 and eventually made her way to new york where she took a job as an assistant at elle magazine in 2005 she moved back to the west coast to los angeles and with a fellow elle alum katherine power created a company best known for its website who what wear which casts an eye on celebrity culture and fashion it now has 13 million monthly unique visitors ms kerr and ms power also started the who what wear clothing and accessories line sold at target it was nine months after their initial meeting that mr leahy emailed ms kerr he had a friend who wanted to get into the fashion industry ms kerr mr leahy and his friend met for a long boozy brunch they began to email and text a bit there was banter ù ms kerr said but neither knew the interest or intention of the other a few months later she texted to ask if he could help her score a ticket to see the band lord huron mr leahy happens to be a friend of ben schneider the band s lead singer and had an extra ticket this was one of those moments where the universe conspires to make you seem cooler than you actually are ù mr leahy said he and ms kerr met up at the show that is when mr leahy and ms kerr moved into the ambiguous mixtape era ù in which for months they emailed and texted each other with coy are we just friends or what ù texts revolving around music for example ms kerr was visiting new york and texted mr leahy a request for walking around soho music ù he sent her a link to love me again ù by john newman it has a club vibe but romantic lyrics i wanted to read into it ù ms kerr said but she figured correctly it turns out that her new friend was a bit of a clueless guy who didn t spend much time thinking about how a woman might react to such a song being shared with her another time he emailed her a link to a fleetwood mac version of need your love so bad ù after listening to it ms kerr said i called my friend katie ù at that time ù she continued i just referred to him as the supervisor she knew i had a crush on him she said how can it not mean something ù mr leahy acknowledged that it might be difficult for a person to think he was not sending ms kerr a message with this song i sort of thought maybe it s too much ù but he shared it with her anyway this is the same man who sent her the song bedbedbedbedbed vacationer remix ù by deleted scenes during the friend phase ù ms kerr said ms kerr played the game too she made mr leahy a mix cd handwritten liner notes and all that she titled feynman diagrams for all ù after mr leahy told her in a text conversation that he thought the idea of feynman diagrams in which physicists map out the interactions of subatomic particles was romantic on the mix ms kerr included the mazzy star song i ve been let down ù it was a bit of an easter egg of my actual feelings ù she said around this time ms kerr texted mr leahy a photo of the drink menu from a bar the roger room she had focused on a drink named for the song christmas card from a hooker in minneapolis ù which happens to be mr leahy s favorite tom waits tune this made me rethink things a bit ù he said adding hillary kerr was clearly not to be trifled with ù in early 2014 mr leahy invited her to a bleachers concert the band s lead singer is jack antonoff who is ms dunham s boyfriend ms dunham was at the concert as well and on meeting ms kerr she said i ve heard so much about you ù ms kerr and mr leahy shared their first kiss that night he proposed to her on polihale beach in kauai hawaii on jan 1 2016 on dec 10 125 friends and relatives gathered in palm springs calif at the colony palms hotel which was opened in 1936 by the reputed mobster al wertheimer

with a bustier and a full skirt four musicians played once with feeling ù an instrumental song mr leahy wrote for ms kerr just minutes into the cocktail reception a few of ms kerr s best friends

maiden name professionally settled into several hours of serious dancing to songs spun by a d j and before they left for their hawaiian honeymoon mr leahy completed his first important act as husband
