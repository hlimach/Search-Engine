doral fla inside a clandestine carnival corporation complex here two former disney executives have been plotting a drastic cruise industry overhaul their mission take lessons learned at walt disney world where they helped bring about a $1 billion vacation management system involving bracelets that link to personal information and apply them to cruises the result millions of passengers on carnival ships will soon be using a similar but more advanced system that allows travelers to do everything from plan vacations to open stateroom doors to order poolside cocktails as long as bigger newer cooler ships have kept coming the cruise industry has treated guest liabilities standing in long lines having a frustrating embarkation experience as acceptable ù said john padgett who joined carnival in 2014 as chief experience and innovation officer after 18 years at disney that thinking stops now ù carnival which operates more than 100 ships worldwide under 10 brands will unveil its ambitious technology initiative on thursday at the consumer electronics show in las vegas in a keynote speech arnold w donald carnival s chief executive intends to announce that the system an app called ocean compass paired with a smart medallion that can be carried in a pocket or worn as jewelry will arrive on the company s princess cruises fleet this year mr donald declined in an interview to give a timeline for bringing the technology code name trident to other carnival brands but he emphasized that rolling out the personalized disks and app was a companywide priority the cost is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and over time more than that ù mr donald said people want the world to be organized around them on vacation even more so ù analysts expect the technology to increase profits in multiple ways including allowing carnival to charge more for tickets particularly on older ships ease of purchase is another big component cruisers will be able to pay for food drinks and merchandise simply by having their credit ocean medallion in their pocket carnival s disks each with the guest s name will also power a new shipwide gambling platform and carnival gift shops will be stocked with a wide array of jewelry clips and key chains that passengers can buy to carry and display their disks carnival s top rival royal caribbean cruises already offers smartbands on ships like the anthem of the seas called wow bands they serve as room keys allow for wireless payment and make it faster and easier to embark and disembark but carnival says that its offering takes such systems much further in part because its technology is designed to be invisible unlike with smartbands there is no need to tap a sensor on a stateroom door for entry simply approaching the correct room with the ocean medallion in your pocket will unlock the door among the medallion system s other offerings is a navigation tool designed to help family members find one another on the ships under mr donald who took over carnival in after a string of ship debacles the company has boomed in the most recent quarter carnival had a record $1 4 billion in net income a 17 percent increase from the same period a year earlier but he remains under pressure to recruit new customers about 24 2 million people worldwide took a cruise in 2016 according to the cruise lines international association that sounds like a lot but cruise vacations only represent about 2 percent of all vacations ù said david beckel an analyst at bernstein research because there is such a low penetration rate any increase in penetration even a minor minor one represents a big difference and hence the effort to improve the customer experience ù mr beckel said as part of its ocean medallion plan carnival has turned to television paying to produce three travel shows designed to make cruising look fun and easy the shows has been broadcast on weekends in recent months on abc nbc and the cw in one episode of the voyager with josh garcia ù the host is seen chatting with artists in puerto rico about making masks from coconuts carnival plans to produce at least 80 episodes in total analysts have praised the effort people have a lot of preconceived notions about cruising that largely aren t true ù said robin m farley an analyst for ubs the system that carnival plans to introduce on thursday still has a lot to prove the technology will require the mass retraining of employees and substantial retrofitting of ships including the installation of roughly 7 000 sensors per boat and do passengers really want to sacrifice privacy for personalization one feature will allow guests to watch live entertainment in ship lounges on their stateroom televisions and the performers will know who is watching and will be trained to do hello to brooks tuning in from his bed on the promenade deck ù mr padgett acknowledged that some guests will have creepiness factor ù questions but he expects the vast majority to participate as long as you benefit the guest they don t mind sharing ù personal information he said using the connected app guests can order food to be delivered wherever they plan to be at a designated time waiters will know who you are because your photograph will pop up on an device when they get close to your medallion by loading preferences into the app while still at home carnival will be able to offer tailored lists of activities the goal of preplanning is learning more about our guests ù said michael g jungen who joined carnival in 2015 as vice president for design and technology after 15 years at disney he noted that passengers would have the option of linking their medallions with social media accounts allowing carnival to delve even deeper as carnival designed the ocean medallion system inside an unmarked building here in suburban miami it built a replica set of staterooms corridors and other ship facilities to test concepts scribbles on a monumental white board in one area contained algorithms and personalization ideas what time you eat dinner what channels you watch ù when they were leading disney s technology effort in 2013 mr padgett and mr jungen built a similar laboratory experimenting with ideas that ultimately became mymagic+ the theme park wristband system that serves as wallet room key admission ticket photograph collector and pass as he gave a reporter a tour of the carnival site mr padgett continually returned to the topic of disney how the cost of cruising compares with a family trip to disney world and how disney frames vacations as overarching stories the ultimate goal here ù he said turning to a disney phrase is to delight and surprise our guests ù
