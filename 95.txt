talladega ala for a band at a tiny historically black college it seems in some ways to be the gig of a lifetime a chance to march and perform at the jan 20 presidential inaugural parade in washington some of the musicians at talladega college have been excited to see the capital for the first time but because the is donald j trump the school has become the subject of an impassioned national outcry with online petitions threats to end donations and a flurry of from alumni who feel that performing in the parade would betray the values of an institution founded by newly freed slaves 150 years ago on thursday after days of speculation that the college administration might bow to the pressure and remove the band from the parade roster the president of talladega college billy hawkins issued a statement confirming the participation of the band the marching tornadoes and argued in essence that the 58th presidential inauguration is about something bigger than mr trump we respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade ù dr hawkins said as many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power ù similar issues have been raised about other entertainers scheduled to perform among them the radio city rockettes and the mormon tabernacle choir but because of talladega s history the issues have been especially intense here with calls for the college to reverse its decision to take part in the festivities and beyond talladega the controversies raise tough questions for mr trump s most ardent critics as his presidency dawns what is the proper response to a president as polarizing as mr trump should the office of the president be honored no matter who fills it or should there be four years of pure rejection and defiance and if mr trump s opponents refuse to participate in his presidency can critics on the right do the same thing to some other in the future to a number of talladega alumni the dec 30 announcement that the band would march in the parade was an insult to the very principles of the college which was established two years after the end of the civil war the school is affiliated with the united church of christ a liberal protestant denomination that was deeply involved in the civil rights movement and for decades it served as an incubator for theories and practices of social justice nikky finney a poet and talladega graduate who is now a professor at the university of south carolina said in a statement this week that the band should not help celebrate mr trump who she said has maligned women and mexican immigrants and has proposed barring all muslims from entering the country in an interview on thursday ms finney channeling a james brown lyric said the college had sold out the history of talladega college for chicken change ù and maybe a tin star on a hatemonger s parade route ù as of thursday afternoon an online petition calling for the band to withdraw from the inaugural parade had attracted more than 1 900 signers some of them supporters of the college who have threatened to withhold future contributions but a second petition which had nearly 300 supporters argued that the parade was not about politics but about seeing firsthand the process of a transition ù and giving the students a chance to be a part of history we are not thinkers and believe everyone is entitled ù to their own beliefs it stated however we are in support of the united states of america ù as the debate heated up this week in online forums for students and alumni the leadership at the private college hunkered down to consider how best to proceed the campus police ordered reporters off the campus brief interviews with a few band members on tuesday evening revealed a group divided jerome haynes 18 a freshman who plays the snare drum said he hoped politics would not get in the way of an exciting opportunity for the band in contrast ronald peterson 21 a sophomore who plays cymbals said he was going to talk to the director about staying home i feel that those who are not republicans should not have to play for it ù he said on thursday afternoon some students said the administration had done the right thing despite the protests from alumni antonio phillips 24 a senior and a drum major welcomed the exposure we re musicians so this is a good platform for us to showcase our talent in front of the world ù he said his friend ken randolph 20 a junior who is not in the band said the concerns of alumni like ms finney weigh heavily on the students of talladega ù but he said mr trump might benefit from the exposure to a black art form this is a part of our culture ù mr randolph said with it being on his front doorstep he might be able to apprehend the vibe and the culture ù that drama in talladega a city of 15 000 about an hour s drive east of birmingham played out as black activists including the n a a c p president cornell william brooks were arrested on tuesday in mobile in a action at the office of senator jeff sessions the alabama republican nominated to be attorney general in the trump administration mr sessions who is white was rejected by the senate for a federal judgeship in 1986 after he was accused of making racially insensitive statements to some talladega alumni the possibility that policies long opposed by could now be enacted by a congress and executive branch was what made the notion of a black band marching for mr trump seem so distasteful there s a great deal of fear in this country that the voting rights act is going to be abolished that the affordable care act is going to be abolished that planned parenthood is going to be cut off from funding that medicaid is going be cut off from funding ù said j mason davis a birmingham lawyer who graduated from the college in 1956 don t you understand why we have a fear of the man ù donavon jackson 24 a former trumpet player in the band who graduated last year said performing as part of the inauguration would be particularly special for a college of about 1 000 students whose band program is only about five years old the school does not have a football team which makes parade invitations all the more important i m honored to go to a school that can say they marched in an inauguration parade ù said mr jackson who received a chemistry degree and now lives in houston not necessarily for the person and that s not necessarily saying he s a bad person ù in the statement on thursday school officials said they still faced the challenge ù of raising more than $60 000 to cover expenses for the trip the population of the city of talladega is divided about evenly between blacks and whites and to a visitor it can feel like a place where racial harmony and discord coexist on seemingly parallel planes whites speak with pride about the historic black college downtown though one white person was overheard on wednesday warning of a liberal plot to foment a race war ù so that president obama might declare martial law before the inauguration while some residents said the band should stay home and others said it should attend the event in washington a few spoke harshly of mr trump while hoping the inauguration would help the band get noticed something the city which was bypassed by the interstate highway system has struggled with in recent decades bonquita mcclellan 26 manages her father s restaurant big mac s open pit bbq near campus ms mcclellan who is black said the disdain for mr trump among her peers was universal if anybody would have had us in concentration camps ù she said it d be him ù but she also said the band should go and make a name for itself in the nation s capital how often ù she asked does talladega college get a chance to play for the president ù up the street at a real estate office near the courthouse randy and heather roberts a white couple who voted for mr trump raved about the talladega college band and its performance at the dec 5 christmas parade ms roberts showed a video of the band on her phone they were phenomenal ù ms roberts said ms roberts 41 said she grew up with black and white friends mr roberts 48 said he and his wife were pleased to cater to their multiracial clientele but when they spoke about politics the couple sounded like people who knew something was broken but did not know how it might be fixed it is not going to be pleasant for the next four years ù ms roberts said it is going to be a battle ù
