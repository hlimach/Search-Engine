seoul south korea north korea s leader kim said on sunday that his country was making final preparations to conduct its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile a bold statement less than a month before the inauguration of donald j trump although north korea has conducted five nuclear tests in the last decade and more than 20 ballistic missile tests in 2016 alone and although it habitually threatens to attack the united states with nuclear weapons the country has never an intercontinental ballistic missile or icbm in his annual new year s day speech which was broadcast on the north s kctv on sunday mr kim spoke proudly of the strides he said his country had made in its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs he said north korea would continue to bolster its weapons programs as long as the united states remained hostile and continued its joint military exercises with south korea we have reached the final stage in preparations to an intercontinental ballistic rocket  he said analysts in the region have said mr kim might conduct another weapons test in coming months taking advantage of leadership changes in the united states and south korea mr trump will be sworn in on jan 20 in south korea president park whose powers were suspended in a parliamentary impeachment on dec 9 is waiting for the constitutional court to rule on whether she should be formally removed from office or reinstated if north korea conducts a test in coming months it will test mr trump s new administration despite years of increasingly harsh sanctions north korea has been advancing toward mr kim s professed goal of arming his isolated country with the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the united states mr kim s speech on sunday indicated that north korea may a rocket several times this year to complete its icbm program said cheong a senior research fellow at the sejong institute in south korea the first of such tests could come even before mr trump s inauguration mr cheong said we need to take note of the fact that this is the first new year s speech where kim mentioned an intercontinental ballistic missile  he said in his speech mr kim did not comment on mr trump s election doubt still runs deep that north korea has mastered all the technology needed to build a reliable icbm but analysts in the region said the north s launchings of rockets to put satellites into orbit in recent years showed that the country had cleared some key technological hurdles after the north s satellite launch in february south korean defense officials said the unha rocket used in the launch if successfully reconfigured as a missile could fly more than 7 400 miles with a warhead of 1 100 to 1 300 pounds far enough to reach most of the united states north korea has deployed rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of south korea and japan but it has had a spotty record in the musudan its ballistic missile with a range long enough to reach american military bases in the pacific including those on guam the north has also claimed a series of successes in testing various icbm technologies although its claims cannot be verified and are often disputed by officials and analysts in the region it has said it could now make nuclear warheads small enough to fit onto a ballistic missile it also claimed success in testing the technology that allows a missile to return to the earth s atmosphere without breaking up in april north korea reported the successful ground test of an engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile at the time mr kim said the north can tip intercontinental ballistic rockets with more powerful nuclear warheads and keep any cesspool of evils in the earth including the u s mainland within our striking range  on sept 9 the north conducted its fifth and most powerful nuclear test mr kim later attended another ground test of a new rocket engine exhorting his government to prepare for another rocket launch as soon as possible in november the united nations security council imposed new sanctions against the north
