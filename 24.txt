pop music and fashion never met cuter than in george michael s freedom 90 ù video sure other catwalk favorites starred in music videos during that era and fashion photographers like steven meisel and herb ritts were recruited by stars such as madonna chris isaak and janet jackson to burnish their visuals but the convergence of a maker s irresistible rhythms and lyrics a group of models at the peak of their fame and a director on the verge of his own runaway success gave freedom 90 ù a jolt of stylish energy that has yet to fade after more than a directed by david fincher who was at the start of his film career and filmed over several days at merton park studios in london the video from mr michael s 1990 album listen without prejudice vol 1 ù brought together five models naomi campbell linda evangelista christy turlington cindy crawford and tatjana patitz who were then the queens of fashion it runs for six and a half minutes and its production also gathered a team of novice professionals who would go on to become major forces in fashion including the stylist camilla nickerson the hairdresser guido palau the makeup artist carol brown and the model john pearson shot in moody romantic tones freedom 90 ù had been viewed more than 37 million times on youtube by the time of mr michael s unexpected death at 53 last sunday reached by phone this week some of the participants recalled their experiences on set and some of the video s most ardent fans reflected on its impact naomi campbell model we d done a british vogue cover with peter lindbergh with all of us i met george in l a and he said i ve been told that i need to speak to you to get the girls for the video what would it take to get you ù we were living in america so i said you d have to fly us in basically i said yes and then christy and tatjana and everyone came in the night before the video i didn t sleep at all because we did five shows for thierry mugler in paris he had 76 models and it was the big finale of him designing although none of us knew that then the last show finished at around 3 o clock in the morning and george was there so from there i went back to my hotel packed my bags and went on the first flight to london david fincher knew exactly what he wanted he didn t really give us parts but he knew exactly which part of the song he wanted each and every one of us to sing i was more the active one cindy was sultry i don t think any of us knew what it would become we knew the song was a hit but we didn t know in any way what effect it would have in terms of videos the way it would affect people we were all really excited on the day it was going to be aired they all had great premieres back in the day they don t have them anymore not that i ve seen mtv s changed hasn t it i got to see george a little bit more after that because kate moss was neighbors with him when we did the olympics he sang there in london we all did the finale and he was rehearsing and kate and i went to watch him with this amazing choir singing freedom ù after he invited us all back to his home and he had this really nice in the garden and we all got to light these wishing lanterns and we all did that together that s the memory i m going to keep guido palau hairdresser i don t know how i got the job george michael and david fincher had seen some of my work in british vogue it was a different time then it was a big big production a video because they had to bring in all the girls every girl had a day though christy and linda were there together my part was to make the girls the best they could look as who they were they weren t playing characters they were playing themselves and each had their own personality linda the comedian christy much more classic cindy the pinup tatjana this kind of film noir and naomi a very strong kind of woman we extracted that from them they weren t prodded at all though there were some surprises like linda s hair which she d done for a job for someone else it wasn t like i said oh dye your hair blond ù not at all at the time we really didn t realize how iconic the video would become i was probably a bit na√Øve about the whole thing seeing how it was a bit of a job for me what i remember most is the days being very long and at the end of the day the red wine would come out there we d be in the location van drinking and singing with george tatjana patitz model i was in my own zone i had to kind of slide up and down the wall for part of the day the feel of the set was so this big loft kind of vibe there was another setup with me laying on a chaise longue with a black smoking jacket i think i may have had a bustier on and i was smoking even people still smoked in videos then and even in films george michael wasn t on the set the day i was there but i d met him a few times in l a herb ritts shot a cover of me and him for a magazine i m trying to remember what magazine it was so many magazines have come and gone glamour was very present in fashion in those days feminine glamour people looking at inspiration from the movie stars of the 40s and 50s audrey hepburn grace kelly and ava gardner a lot of magazines were pairing models with pop stars or movie stars to shoot covers it was very different those days the business was much smaller and wasn t as saturated not as fast as it is now models were known by their first names and suddenly the glamour we embodied at that time crossed over to pop music videos and film we were part of the entertainment industry which made it really fun george was very nice almost a little shy maybe that s the wrong word he was mellow and kind i was quite at the time because i grew up with wham and their music he was one of my first teenage crushes in the five or so times i met him he was always very pleasant and sweet but timid not one of those vivacious people who take a room by storm i remember the shoot being in fall or early winter i flew in on the concorde for the day and flew back to new york right after that it s funny a lot of people were using models in videos then but this one in particular stood the test of time it s not like you look at freedom 90 ù now and say oh my god it s so 80s ù it s not like working girl ù john pearson model my agent called up and said hey do you want to do this video all the big girls are doing it ù of course i said yes i was a big george michael fan i used to see him all the time in london at the clubs i arrived at the studios at 3 o clock in the afternoon and met david fincher briefly and then basically sat around all day and watched while christy and linda were being shot there s one shot where linda puts her head underneath her sweater that s amazing that wasn t rehearsed linda really knows how to use her body to communicate in an elegant way never cheap and tawdry george was there very warm and nice but very shy the day went long and the producer said at the end of the day can we shoot you tomorrow ù i didn t have another job booked so i said sure ù then he said do you mind doing it for nothing ù i said no way ù it was a little bit bolshie of me but i knew what the girls were getting in the end i was paid $15 000 for the day which is not bad to hang out with these fabulous beautiful girls but i d been working nonstop for three years and i wasn t going to do it for free and it turned out to be one of those fabulously easy jobs everyone riding on this wave of semistardom and recognition for the models i really didn t realize how big it all was at the time candis cayne actress model and former drag personality there was a group of girls in n y c in the 90s and we didn t want to model ourselves on anything other than the supermodels linda and naomi and christy so when the video of freedom ù came out and they were all in it we were obsessed i used to do shows at boy bar so i decided i was going to do freedom ù and got lina and mistress formika and sherry vine to play the various parts i was linda she was my favorite we did the whole thing naked under white sheets after the very last chorus we dropped the sheets and were completely naked holding our groin areas that song meant a lot to us there were singers we knew were gay then but no one really talked about it we just grabbed onto songs and artists who knew who and what we were whether it was madonna with vogue ù and truth or dare ù or george michael with freedom ù i don t know if he was openly gay or not then i guess not but it was almost o k because we all knew and it was such a homophobic time it was so oppressive particularly when you factor in the aids epidemic to be open would have been a career killer but going to a club listening to freedom ù it was an escape alan hunter one of the original mtv v j s it was a funny moment in my life i was driving my kid to day care on a day where i didn t know where my career had gone i d left mtv my agent wasn t calling i was depressed and i turned on the radio and on came george michael s new song it was george michael at the peak of his writing skills it was such a brilliant capstone i d ever heard it was his song he was saying everything that brought me to pop stardom i now disavow ù then i saw the video shortly thereafter with all that iconography he d used in his past and he literally sets those things on fire and explodes them the leather jacket he d worn and the jukebox from faith ù and he just steps away he wasn t even in the video it showed how serious he was even while he said it all with a lot of love it was such a joyous song i actually felt happy zac posen fashion designer i was 10 years old 10 or 11 i d see it in my living room waiting for madonna to come on i probably wanted to be the child in open your heart ù but what i remember about freedom ù was that it was kind of a seminal predecessor to grunge because you have these incredibly glamorous beauties in a very industrial corinne day space there s water dripping down the walls and george michael s leather jacket is on fire and the models are naked it was really the glamour of the 80s transitioning into something more raw that was to come
