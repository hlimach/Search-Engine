ñ† donald j trump appears to side with the wikileaks founder julian assange over united states intelligence agencies with vice mike pence backing him up ñ† she s hired omarosa manigault gets a white house post as do some notable trump loyalists but mr trump is leaning on republican veterans in the oval office s top slots ñ† the finds something very strange ù about his intelligence briefing on friday even though the white house says it was always planned for friday for the republican party mr assange the wikileaks founder was once purely a villain he found little sympathy with conservatives after he leaked american military secrets from iraq published purloined diplomatic cables that could have gotten american sources killed and sought refuge in the ecuadorean embassy in london fleeing charges of rape but now mr trump appears to be siding with mr assange over the conclusions of america s intelligence services mr assange appeared on fox news on tuesday night with sean hannity one of mr trump s biggest news media boosters to declare once again that the russians were not the source of the purloined emails that wikileaks released from the democratic national committee and the personal account of hillary clinton s campaign chairman john podesta mr trump followed that appearance with a series of twitter posts on wednesday that appeared to be preparing his followers for battle once more information on intelligence findings was released most likely by thursday there were actually two separate hackings that the obama administration has said came from russian intelligence with 100 percent ù certainty as he has previously mr assange said our source is not the russian government it is not state parties ù but mr assange has often said that the organization does not always know the identity of its sources it is highly unlikely that anyone approaching wikileaks with the emails obtained by russian government hacking would acknowledge the source so it is likely that mr assange cannot be sure of the origin of the emails mr assange and mr hannity did not address that in addition to wikileaks the leaked democratic material was published by two mysterious websites dcleaks com and a blog written by someone called guccifer 2 0 american intelligence agencies say they believe both were created by russian agents in addition to american intelligence agencies most private researchers also say they believe that the d n c and podesta hackings were carried out on orders of russian government officials though a few skeptics say they believe the case is unproven by the evidence made public mr assange s statement is unlikely to change that conclusion intelligence officials will brief congress on their russia inquiry on thursday ahead of a briefing for mr trump in new york on friday senator john mccain of arizona chairman of the senate armed services committee will hold the first hearing on the matter on thursday as well as for that terrible ù information mentioned by mr trump the cnn commentator donna brazile did send mr podesta an email ahead of a democratic presidential debate in flint mich tipping him off that a woman in the audience would ask why the government was not doing more to help clean the city s water supply that was in fact reported widely and often here and here and here and here among other places and that was hardly an unexpected query for mrs clinton or for her rival senator bernie sanders of vermont it did cause ms brazile to lose her cnn post the appears to be getting a jump on the news vice mike pence defended mr trump s assange posts at a capitol hill news conference wednesday effectively doubling down on the incoming administration s icy blasts toward united states intelligence mr trump expressed his very sincere and healthy american skepticism about intelligence conclusions ù mr pence said with house republican leaders by his side mr trump s remarks have again placed fellow republicans in an uncomfortable position asked on wednesday morning about the twitter post speaker paul d ryan steered clear of criticizing the saying he would not be commenting on every little tweet or facebook post ù but he called mr assange a sycophant for russia ù who leaks steals data and compromises national security ù mr ryan noted that mr trump had not yet received his latest briefing on russia hopefully he ll get up to speed on what s been happening and what russia has or has not done ù he said ms manigault the villain and diva from mr trump s reality television show the apprentice ù was officially named assistant to the president and director of communications for the white house office of public liaison one of a slate of wednesday appointments that went to ardent trump loyalists the appointments include bill stepien a confidant of gov chris christie of new jersey and a figure in the bridgegate ù scandal who will be white house political director keith schiller who was head of private security at mr trump s real estate company will be director of oval office operations john destefano a longtime aide to former house speaker john a boehner will direct presidential personnel and george gigicos who organized those giant campaign rallies will be director of advance a further indicator that mr trump plans to continue that sort of thing as president but for star power no one is going to beat ms manigault ms manigault aside mr trump is turning to some seasoned veterans to run key operations in his white house mr trump announced on wednesday that he had selected joe hagin who served for 14 years in the white house under roanld reagan george bush and george w bush as his deputy chief of staff for operations a key post in which he will be responsible for organizing presidential trips and security among other things he named rick dearborn who has 25 years of experience on capitol hill as his chief liaison to congress heading the office of legislative affairs as well as the office of intergovernmental affairs and cabinet affairs katie walsh who was chief of staff at the republican national committee under reince priebus mr trump s incoming chief of staff will become his deputy at the white house overseeing senior staff scheduling and the office of public liaison in a statement mr priebus called the three a team of doers ù who would fill critical roles kellyanne conway who served as counselor to mr trump said she was thrilled to have another strong female leader ù on the team in ms walsh first mr trump said that the nation should move beyond talk of russian interference in the presidential election but that he would listen to what american intelligence experts had to say then on new year s eve the promised that by tuesday or wednesday he would reveal information on the hacking that americans do not know and now he seems to think the intelligence community has not quite gotten its story straight the obama administration quickly let it be known that in fact intelligence leaders always intended to brief mr trump on friday in new york and intelligence officials were not amused nor were some republican political consultants but this is not the first time the has taken a swipe at the intelligence community which has concluded that russia tried to help get him elected president president obama is on capitol hill on wednesday to plot a strategy to save his signature domestic achievement the affordable care act vice mike pence countered with his own visit to congressional republicans the first order of business is to repeal and replace obamacare ù mr pence said it needs to be done ù and mr trump weighed in on twitter trying to stiffen republican spines as democrats press their point that a fast gutting of the law will endanger the health care of 20 million people covered under the law and put at risk tens of millions more with health problems schumer clowns ù may not be an olive branch to senator chuck schumer of new york the new minority leader but it is a signal that the incoming president is ready for war over health care republicans should stop clowning around with americans medicare medicaid and health care ù mr schumer responded after meeting with the president he warned that republicans would throw the entire health care system into chaos ù representative nancy pelosi of california the house minority leader tried to coin a phrase make america sick again is that what republicans want ù the trump transition office named the lawyer jay clayton to be the next chairman of the securities and exchange commission the last time mr trump held a real news conference was on july 27 when he said president vladimir v putin of russia had called him a genius and wrongly insisted that many people ù saw bombs strewn all over the floor of the san bernardino calif attackers home and failed to report it that long stretch without a real news media grilling did not do him much harm he did after all win the election but he says he will hold a true open news conference next wednesday no word yet whether this session will take the place of the one he scheduled for last month then canceled to specifically reveal his plans for the future of his corporation
