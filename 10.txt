angels are everywhere in the mu√±iz family s apartment in the bronx paintings of angels on the wall ceramic angels flanking the ancient vcr angels strumming lyres or blowing little golden trumpets on the bathroom shelves as jos√© and zoraida mu√±iz and their children have struggled to deal with a series of trials and setbacks including cancer debilitating epilepsy deep depression and near eviction it has sometimes seemed as if angels and love were the only forces holding things together zoraida s early life in puerto rico was like something from a tropical dickens novel she and her siblings and mother built a house by hand after a hurricane ravaged their home and the children s father withdrew support then zoraida s grandfather the father of her absent father destroyed the house in a rage she was barely a teenager when she met jos√© a vietnam war veteran with permission from her uncle a judge they were married she was 14 he was 29 they moved to new york in 1983 and started a new life he built boilers she worked in construction using skills she learned as a child and in a clothing store but in 1987 mr mu√±iz began having violent seizures eight or 10 a day they did not respond to medication he could no longer work she stopped working to take care of him still determined to live something like a normal life they started a family their first child jos√© jr had a heart defect by the time he was 2 he had had six operations that s where the angels came in the first one was a painting a gift from a cousin when they operated on my son they told me he was an angel because he was supposed to die ù ms mu√±iz 50 said from there i figured that angels are taking care of me and protecting me and my family ù all the angels are gifts from friends and relatives or picked up off the street just like all the furniture in the mu√±izes overstuffed apartment in a complex on westchester avenue in the bronx much of it restored by ms mu√±iz so many people throw away things so i don t have to buy ù she said a second son jesus became epileptic at 3 a girl maria completed the family in 2007 mr mu√±iz had what felt like a horrible stubborn toothache it turned out to be cancer of the lower jaw ms mu√±iz stayed in the room with her husband while he received radiation treatment i m willing to take anything with him ù she said i never left him alone and i never will ù radiation did not work to save mr mu√±iz s life surgeons removed his tongue and his lower jaw and cut a hole through his esophagus disfigured depressed and unable to speak he can consume nothing thicker than milk and needs care this is the household where the mu√±iz children grew up we ve been through every craziness ù said jos√© jr 24 who has suffered depression so severe that he dropped out of college and confined himself to the apartment every up and down ù for years at a time the family held on seemingly by a thread over the summer the younger son jesus 22 got a job at a zaro s bakery in manhattan s financial district because the family s rent is tied to income the rent tripled in august to about $770 a month from $245 but jesus had school bills to pay and the family paid some of the funeral expenses for jos√© sr s mother who died over the summer and things began to unravel they fell behind on the rent and utilities food was often scarce the family regularly skipped meals it was around this time that ms mu√±iz got in touch with catholic charities archdiocese of new york one of the eight organizations supported by the new york times s neediest cases fund it covered their back rent got them warm coats and blankets and helped them apply for food stamps for the first time and with $600 from the neediest cases fund the family paid its electric bill things are looking up in some ways jesus is returning to college where he is on a track and wants to be a paramedic maria graduated in december from a nursing program thinking of her father and his illness she wants to be an oncologist jos√© jr was just accepted to the new york film academy s photography program but jos√© sr continues to battle cancer zoraida is severely depressed what keeps her going she was asked she gestured toward her family sitting beside her beneath the painted angels they give me my strength even if i have times i collapse ù she said jos√© jr agreed i use my parents and siblings as my motivation ù he said we re all there for each other ù ms mu√±iz said
