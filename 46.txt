jerusalem the fate of just one israeli soldier was hanging in the balance but for many israelis the guilty verdict announced on wednesday was a critical turn in the battle for the character of the state when the military judges convicted sgt elor azaria of manslaughter for shooting a palestinian assailant in the head as he lay wounded on the ground they were ruling not just on his conduct but also on the host of ethical and political issues it raised since the shooting in the occupied west bank city of hebron in march the case has polarized israelis and rocked the pedestal on which the military normally stands with the 50th anniversary of israel s occupation of the west bank approaching the highly charged trial had fueled a debate about military ethics and the place of the army in israeli society the verdict did little to heal the rifts the trial had exposed hours after it was rendered prime minister benjamin netanyahu joined a chorus of voices calling for the soldier to be pardoned this is a difficult and painful day for us all ù mr netanyahu said in a facebook post supporting a pardon which can be granted by israel s president or the army s top officials referring to the israel defense forces he added the soldiers of the i d f are our sons and daughters and they need to remain above any dispute ù prof david enoch an expert in the philosophy of law at the hebrew university of jerusalem said he thought the manslaughter conviction was justified ù but added i m not sure this verdict will be welcomed by many of the soldiers and much of the public ù the military s rules make clear that assailants must be quickly incapacitated but that once the threat is neutralized they should not be killed rights groups and other critics have accused israeli soldiers and police officers of being too quick to pull the trigger particularly in response to a recent spate of deadly stabbings shootings and car attacks by palestinians the hebron killing caught in chilling completeness in a video that quickly went viral worldwide for many critics crystallized the question of excessive force and even military leaders said sergeant azaria acted without justification but in israel a country where military service is a part of national identity many jews called for backing up young soldiers sent on dangerous missions and said that sergeant azaria had been in an impossible situation and had little chance of an acquittal since that would have put his commanders in a bad light israel s defense minister avigdor lieberman called wednesday s decision a tough verdict ù the first thing i ask of all of us those who like the verdict and those like me who like it much less we are all obligated to respect the court s decision ù mr lieberman said we are obligated to maintain restraint ù mr lieberman as a member of the parliamentary opposition before his cabinet appointment had attended the military court to support sergeant azaria and called the legal proceedings a theater of the absurd ù but on wednesday he said we must keep the army above and beyond all political argument ù politicians to mr netanyahu s right and left have also called for a pardon including the education minister naftali bennett and shelly yacimovich of the labor party who said that azaria s shoulders are too narrow to bear the entire weight of the fissure ù the case has exposed some israeli experts compared the azaria verdict to the kafr qassem ruling of more than 60 years ago after border police officers fatally shot 49 arab men women and children as they returned from work in the fields unwittingly breaking a curfew the murder convictions of officers in that case established that security forces must refuse to follow a patently illegal order ù that carries a black flag ù of criminality it helped shape the army s ethos now some fear that in the lower ranks it has begun to erode in a measure of the tensions the verdict was handed down in a special court inside the walled and heavily guarded compound of the military s headquarters in tel aviv rather than in the courtroom where the trial was held to keep demonstrators at bay video footage showed sergeant azaria smiling as he entered the courtroom to applause and he was embraced by his family and friends hundreds of protesters gathered outside the compound shouting slogans like free the boy ù col maya heller one of the military judges spent more than two and a half hours delivering the verdict she systematically rejected the main points of the defense and said there had been no justification ù for the shooting according to reports from the courtroom describing sergeant azaria s telling of the event as twisting ù and evolving ù the judge said the defense had tried to hold the rope at both ends ù on one hand it asserted that the victim abed appeared to pose a danger because he was still moving and on the other it brought medical witnesses who contended that he was dead by the time sergeant azaria shot him in the head the judge seemed to give great weight to statements sergeant azaria a medic who was 19 at the time made at the scene indicating he had acted not out of fear but for revenge a soldier testified that before the shooting sergeant azaria had said how is it that my friend was stabbed and the terrorist is still alive ù after the shooting a commander who was at the scene recalled sergeant azaria saying the terrorist deserved to die ù ilan katz one of sergeant azaria s lawyers vowed to appeal the military s high command had denounced the shooting immediately after it happened calling it a grave breach of proper military conduct but israeli society was divided against the backdrop of continued palestinian attacks many politicians and celebrities along with jewish parents of soldiers hailed sergeant azaria as a hero mr netanyahu first condemned sergeant azaria s actions then phoned the soldier s family to offer sympathy and reassurances that he would be treated fairly local television stations frequently showed images of sergeant azaria s distraught parents hugging him in court appealing to public sentiment in a country blighted by wars and terrorism and where most jewish are conscripted for up to 32 months of military service his supporters portrayed him as everybody s child ù in remarks recorded before the verdict the military s chief of staff lt gen gadi eisenkot tried to puncture that narrative an in the israeli army is not everybody s child ù he said he is a fighter a soldier who must dedicate his life to carry out the tasks we give him we cannot be confused about this ù the episode began when two palestinian men stabbed and wounded an israeli soldier at a checkpoint in hebron israeli soldiers killed one and wounded the other mr sharif 21 sergeant azaria arrived at the scene about six minutes later the video showed calm had been restored yet 11 minutes after the initial attack he cocked his rifle and shot mr sharif as he lay on the road lawyers representing sergeant azaria said he had acted to save his comrades in the belief that mr sharif who was still moving might have been concealing an explosive belt under his jacket but sergeant azaria did not warn the other soldiers or the medical staff nearby to move away during the trial sergeant azaria s company commander maj tom naaman said he did not feel any danger ù from mr sharif undercutting the defendant s claims yusri mr sharif s father told reporters that the verdict was a good step ù but that he hoped there would be no lenience in the sentencing which is scheduled for jan 15 ahmad tibi an arab member of the israeli parliament said on twitter that dozens of soldiers and commanders who killed palestinians should have been convicted fifty years of occupation add up to much more than one azaria ù mr tibi wrote
