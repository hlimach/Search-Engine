for megyn kelly the shift from fox news to nbc where she will host a daily daytime show and a sunday newsmagazine program will be a test of whether she can connect with a broader audience in a different format and reach another level of television stardom but her move announced tuesday has broader implications for the television news industry raising new questions about the future of fox news where she was a countervailing presence in an opinion lineup heavy with ideology and of nbc news which has been a longtime b√™te noire for conservative press critics and it comes as all news organizations gird for a new era of media coverage that arrives jan 20 with the inauguration of donald j trump the murdoch family which controls fox news s parent company 21st century fox had become so invested in ms kelly as a franchise that they were prepared to pay her a salary of more than $20 million a year people inside and outside the network widely took that to mean the murdochs were staking the network s future on a journalist who effectively made her name by upending the expectations for a fox news anchor for instance by publicly taking on the republican nominee for president but now fox news long the cable news ratings leader and an influential voice in the national political debate is on course to begin coverage of a new administration with no anchor with ms kelly s history of challenging mr trump her show the kelly file ù was sandwiched between the program of bill o reilly she was regularly second to him in the cable news ratings and that of mr trump s major booster sean hannity her departure coming after that of greta van susteren also means that fox faces the prospect of having no female host in prime time that is a potentially troubling development for the network as its seeks to move past last summer s sexual harassment scandal involving its and former chairman roger ailes in which many women described experiencing harassment or intimidation fox is said to be looking at several potential female successors for ms kelly for nbc the addition of ms kelly 46 may help address a challenge confronting many major news organizations connecting with a politically diverse audience in bringing ms kelly to nbc andrew lack the chairman of the news division is adding a journalist schooled in the preferences and worldviews of the conservative americans who helped elect mr trump and whose anger so many news organizations failed to appreciate ms kelly s closely watched career move capped months of drama in the political sphere in which she was often at the center of mr trump s intense campaign and in the media world where she became a key figure in the events that led to mr ailes s ouster ms kelly was the most prominent among a group of women at the network who told internal investigators that mr ailes had engaged in inappropriate behavior mr ailes has denied all the accusations despite having made a generous offer to ms kelly rupert murdoch an executive chairman of 21st century fox whose negotiation tactics are legendary offered a supportive statement about her decision to leave we thank megyn kelly for her 12 years of contributions to fox news ù the statement read we hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family the best ù though the loss of ms kelly is a blow to fox news the network has a winning formula that has kept it atop the ratings for many years and helped it to avoid the its rivals experienced in the weeks after election day as the associated press reported and now the nation has a new republican president whose approach speaks to the sensibilities of many of fox s viewers company executives said the murdochs knew ms kelly was a flight risk their offer included keeping her in prime time and she had made it clear she was seeking a job that would give her more time for her family ms kelly had spoken with top executives at abc news cnn and in the syndication industry as well as nbc news but nbc remained largely under the radar as a landing spot one person briefed on ms kelly s deliberations said that mr lack won her over by starting the talks with a question about what she was seeking instead of flatly offering possibilities he then came back with a deal that was tailored to her preferences a daytime show would give her a schedule that would allow her to see her children off to school and to have dinner with them and her husband douglas brunt a novelist people briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity declined to disclose what ms kelly s new annual salary would be at nbc fox news rivals who sought to hire ms kelly away including nbc news had indicated that they could not match the $20 million offer from fox the cable news leader for the last 15 years running but even a modest raise for ms kelly would place her among television s journalists the wall street journal recently reported she was to collect $15 million for the final year of her contract her high price tag was worth it for mr lack who took over leadership of nbc news and msnbc in 2015 14 years after he had ended an tenure running the divisions executives at nbc universal turned to him to stabilize the network after the suspension of the nightly news anchor brian williams for embellishing accounts of his reporting in iraq and as msnbc floundered in the ratings among his moves since returning has been to direct msnbc back toward more traditional hard news coverage during its daytime hours like its cable news rivals it hit record ratings highs last year and away from its yearslong market position as a answer to fox news which at times colored the reputation of its sister nbc news ms kelly will not be reporting for msnbc which still has hosts like rachel maddow and lawrence o donnell in a brief interview mr lack said he would be closely involved in the creation of ms kelly s daytime show which will run monday through friday at a time to be determined as well as the one she will anchor on sunday nights that show will be in the vein of cbs s 60 minutes ù where mr lack worked early in his career the thing about this that is challenging but exciting as hell is that we love making new shows ù he said you don t get that opportunity that often any more and you don t get the opportunity to do that with a talent like megyn ù yet the move has its risks for all involved especially the daytime program daytime television has been notoriously difficult for news stars people involved in the discussions said that the program was not planned to be in the mold of a traditional daytime talk show nor much like the special ms kelly hosted last may on the fox broadcast network which drew some harsh criticism some of which ms kelly dismissed as liberal disappointment over a friendly interview with mr trump in an interview with charlie rose on cbs sunday morning ù last year ms kelly described the television show of her fantasies how about if we merge a little charlie rose a little oprah and a little me all together she said and we serve that up as an hour wouldn t you watch that ù ms kelly kept a relatively low profile on tuesday addressing her own news at the end of that night s edition of the kelly file ù this was a tough decision for me ù ms kelly said thanking the murdochs and attributing the move in part to her desire for more time with her children her last show on fox is on friday
