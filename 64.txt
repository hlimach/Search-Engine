istanbul turkish officials accused the united states of abetting a failed coup last summer when the russian ambassador to turkey was assassinated last month the turkish press said the united states was behind the attack and once again after a gunman walked into an istanbul nightclub early on new year s day and killed dozens the news media pointed a finger at the united states america chief suspect ù one headline blared after the attack on twitter a turkish lawmaker referring to the name of the nightclub wrote whoever the triggerman is reina attack is an act of cia period ù turkey has been confronted with a cascade of crises that seem to have only accelerated as the syrian civil war has spilled across the border but the events have not pushed turkey closer to its nato allies conversely they have drifted further apart as the nation lashes out at washington and moves closer to moscow working with the russian president vladimir v putin to secure a in syria one story in the turkish press based on a routine travel warning issued by the american embassy in turkey was that the united states had advance knowledge of the nightclub attack which the islamic state later claimed responsibility for another suggested that stun grenades used by the gunman had come from stocks held by the american military still another claimed the assault was a plot by the united states to sow divisions in turkey between the secular and the religious rather than bringing the united states and turkey together in the common fight against terrorism the nightclub attack even with the gunman still on the run appears to have only accelerated turkey s shift away from the west at a time when its democracy is eroding amid a growing crackdown on civil society all of this is a reflection many critics say of what they call the paranoia and authoritarianism of turkey s president recep tayyip erdogan whose leadership has so deeply divided the country that instead of unifying to confront terrorism turkish society is fracturing further with each attack the west symbolized by the united states is the perennial bogeyman while seeming to pile on the obama administration in its waning days by accusing it of supporting turkey s enemies including the islamic state kurdish militants and supporters of an exiled muslim cleric fethullah gulen whom mr erdogan blamed for directing the coup turkish officials are also telegraphing something else that they are willing to open the door and improve relations with the united states once donald j trump takes office our expectation from the new administration is to end this shame ù turkey s prime minister binali yildirim said this week while accusing the united states of providing weapons to kurdish militants in syria who are fighting the islamic state but are also an enemy of turkey we are not holding the new administration responsible for this ù mr yildirim said because this is the work of the obama administration ù meanwhile the nightclub assailant is on the loose the turkish authorities said on wednesday that they had identified the killer but refused to release any other details although photographs of the man from surveillance cameras have been released also a video surfaced that appeared to show the assailant recording himself in istanbul s taksim square a senior united states official who has been briefed on the investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential details said the turks had recovered the video from a raid on a house in istanbul the official said the turks now believed the killer was from uzbekistan not kyrgyzstan as many reports this week had first suggested the official expressed alarm at the growing in turkey which seems to accumulate after each crisis here and said it put the lives of americans in the country in jeopardy the chaotic investigation has added to the anxiety on istanbul s streets with vehicle checkpoints night raids on houses and helicopters there is significant fear in ordinary people ù said aydin engin a columnist at the daily newspaper cumhuriyet who was detained last year as part of the government s crackdown on the news media fear prevails when it comes to going to an entertainment place being in a crowd going to a shopping mall getting on the metro ù with each passing day public life descends deeper into what many turks concede is a mix of darkness and seeming absurdity with growing fears of violence and expressions of xenophobia set next to repressions on civic life in the days before and after the nightclub massacre on the shores of the bosporus nationalists staged a mock execution of santa claus in the name of defending islam a reporter for the wall street journal was detained and placed in solitary confinement for according to the newspaper s account violating a government ban on publication of images from an islamic state video ù and a fashion designer was beaten up at the istanbul airport and arrested for his social media posts in a way it s basically a breakdown of order ù said soli ozel a turkish columnist and academic seeking to explain the tumult in society everyone feels entitled to do whatever they want to do and how they want to do it ù tugrul eryilmaz another longtime turkish journalist recalled the country s military coup in 1980 and the crackdown on civil society that followed and said i have never been in such a situation like today ù he brought up the spanish filmmaker luis bu√±uel who was known for surreal and absurd themes i feel like i am in his movies ù he said while turkey faces a growing terrorism threat the country is also largely at war with itself with deep divisions along many lines religion class ethnicity that make unity difficult even in a time of crisis perhaps the greatest source of division is between supporters of mr erdogan about half the country and opponents who assert that he has become too powerful turkey is so deeply polarized around the powerful persona of erdogan that instead of asking why terror attacks are happening and how they can be stopped the and blocks in the country are blaming each other ù said soner cagaptay a specialist on turkey at the washington institute for near east policy this is why i am deeply worried about turkey and the country s ability to stymie further terror attacks ù parliament voted overnight to extend by three months the state of emergency that went into effect last summer after the failed coup the emergency grants mr erdogan s government extraordinary powers to detain perceived opponents and hold them in pretrial detention tens of thousands of people have either been arrested or been purged from their jobs on suspicion of having links to mr gulen who now lives in pennsylvania mr erdogan on wednesday made his first public remarks since the attack on sunday morning a striking period of silence for a man who is normally ubiquitous in the public sphere often giving speeches daily mr erdogan an islamist rejected criticism that his government in pushing an islamist agenda had deepened divisions between the secular and the pious many on social media in the aftermath of the nightclub attack noted that the turkish government s religious authorities had denounced new year s celebrations as as the president of all 79 million citizens ù mr erdogan said it is my duty to protect everyone s rights law and spaces of freedom ù mr erdogan who spoke this week with president obama in a condolence call also told his audience what he believed turkey in facing so many terrorist attacks was really up against a plot by the west invoking the collapse of the ottoman empire after world war i and the subsequent turkish war against western armies and their proxies he said today turkey is in a new struggle for independence ù
