after more than five years of investigations and negotiations the curious case of mf global is finally closed on thursday federal regulators announced a $5 million settlement with jon s corzine who ran mf global when it collapsed into bankruptcy in 2011 and lost more than $1 billion in customer money the settlement reached unanimously at the commodity futures trading commission in the waning days of the obama administration and approved by a federal judge this week caps a spectacle that derailed mr corzine s career and spurred a number of congressional criminal and regulatory investigations the regulatory case arose in 2013 when the commodities agency sued mr corzine a democratic former new jersey senator and governor saying he had failed to diligently supervise ù the firm as it jeopardized the clients accounts the agency did not directly link mr corzine 70 to the missing money but it did accuse a employee in chicago edith o brien of aiding and abetting ù the misuse of customer money saying she allowed it to be used to plug holes in mf global s own accounts to resolve the case mr corzine has agreed to pay the $5 million penalty out of his own pocket while the sum is manageable for someone who reaped many millions of dollars as a top goldman sachs executive before pursuing a career in politics it is an unusual step in other federal cases involving wall street insurance money often covers settlement amounts sparing the executives themselves while mr corzine was willing to settle the case ms o brien nearly took it to trial but in recent weeks she too agreed to settle striking a deal that has imposed a $500 000 penalty and an prohibition on her associating with a futures broker like mf global mr corzine agreed to a harsher undertaking accepting a lifetime prohibition from leading a futures broker or registering with the commodity futures trading commission in effect that means he will not personally trade other people s money in the futures industry except for smaller trades under certain threshold limits mr corzine in theory could still operate a hedge fund that does futures trading and he could trade for his own account the settlement also does not prevent him from trading in other markets this resolution demonstrates the importance that the commission attaches to customer protection which has long been a hallmark of our mission ù aitan goelman the head of the commodity futures trading commission enforcement division said in a statement announcing the settlement the settlements the contours of which were reported by the new york times in october bring a close to the mf global ordeal the criminal investigations ended with the conclusion that mf global employees did not intentionally break the law just last year mr corzine settled much of the private mf global litigation and a trustee has long recovered the missing customer money much of it wound up at mf global s banks and clearinghouses and made whole the farmers and hedge funds whose accounts were raided in the firm s final days in a statement on thursday mr corzine said as the c e o of mf global in 2011 i have accepted responsibility for its failure and i deeply regret the impact it had on customers employees shareholders and others ù he added i remain gratified that several years ago all customer money was recovered and returned to mf global customers ù his lawyer andrew j levander said mr corzine has given more than 10 days of testimony under oath and these matters have been investigated exhaustively by two u s attorney s offices the f b i the s e c the c f t c finra and congress ù finra is the financial industry regulatory authority and yet mr levander said none of these investigations have led to allegations that mr corzine engaged in any kind of intentional misconduct or fraud or that he was at any time not truthful in his many hours of testimony ù the case also concludes a political challenge for the commodities agency which came under fire for not preventing a breach of customer money at a firm it regulated compounding the pressure mr corzine was a sensitive target a prominent democrat who has been a confidant of leaders in washington and on wall street against that backdrop the agency extracted the $5 million payout from mr corzine a sum far greater than what it could have expected to win if he had been found liable at trial during negotiations with mr corzine last year the commission also strengthened aspects of the deal after some of the agency s commissioners questioned it the new york times reported at the time the case against mr corzine was among the agency s biggest enforcement actions in the obama administration and after mf global s demise on halloween in 2011 the commodities agency used the episode to tighten the rules for protecting customer money the disappearance of the money from mf global unnerved the futures industry and raised broader concerns about the safety of customer funds across wall street further review showed that mf global s financial straits left it vulnerable to a breach mr corzine joined mf global as chief executive and chairman in 2010 after the firm had lost money in each of the previous three years in hopes of returning the firm to profitability and perhaps transforming it into a miniature goldman sachs mr corzine placed a large wager on european sovereign debt at a time when investors feared defaults in the eurozone although his bet ultimately would have been profitable for mf global and the european bonds paid out for other firms that bought the debt it was not enough to save the firm from unrelated woes mf global s auditor for example made the firm write down the value of a significant future tax benefit a move that appeared to unnerve mf global s investors as well as ratings agencies and after a series of ratings downgrades the firm started to unravel in mf global s final days it overdrew an account at jpmorgan chase one of its banks and scrambled to patch that hole that is when the improper transfers of customer money accelerated according to the commodity futures trading commission s complaint minutes after learning of the overdrawn account mr corzine told ms o brien that meeting the bank s demands was the most important thing ù she could get done that day ù ultimately in the chaos and confusion of those final days customer money was transferred to jpmorgan and yet mr corzine was not accused of instructing ms o brien to use customer money for this purpose according to court records submitted by his lawyers mr corzine was not told that the firm was at risk of violating the rules until the eve of the bankruptcy after the breach had happened in an email ms o brien told mr corzine that the transfer to jpmorgan was a house wire ù meaning it came from the firm s accounts in the years since mr corzine has visited central america for a humanitarian project and has traded with his own money his philanthropic efforts have included working with covenant house a nonprofit focused on helping homeless children with this matter resolved ù he said i am eager to move forward and plan to spend my time focused on issues that have always been important in my life my family community and philanthropic causes and markets ù
