writers are different from the rest of us their castoff scraps can be worth money not to mention the obsessive attentions of future scholars jonathan lethem 52 recently became the latest author to sell his personal paper trail to a major archive the beinecke rare book manuscript library at yale university acquired a trove of his manuscripts letters notes and other artifacts which will now sit alongside material from walt whitman sinclair lewis james baldwin and marilynne robinson in its rich american literature collection mr lethem s papers contain items relating to the novels that made him something of a reluctant patron saint of brooklyn s literary ascendance including motherless brooklyn ù 1999 and the fortress of solitude ù 2003 but as befits a lifelong collector music obsessive comics geek and dedicated chronicler of underground culture there are also cartoons new york 1970s ephemera and what is surely the largest cache of drawings of vomiting cats in any university collection for an author who is so much fun as a novelist it s interesting to see there is so much fun in his archival documents as well ù said melissa barton the curator of american prose and drama at the beinecke ms barton citing library policy declined to say what yale paid in the sale which was arranged by the manhattan book dealer glenn horowitz mr lethem s archive also includes two computer hard drives a laptop and other digital materials especially from more recent years you can feel the evaporation of the physical ephemera ù mr lethem whose most recent novel a gambler s anatomy ù appeared in october said in an interview but the bulk of the collection consists of artifacts some of them charmingly weird we asked mr lethem who left new york in 2010 to teach creative writing at pomona college in claremont calif about some of the odder items in his literary closet the archive includes a number of comic books mr lethem made as a child featuring invented superheroes like man whose origin story included an attempt to start a nudist colony in alaska in one installment man who later got a passing in the fortress of solitude ù battled ed koch who was no hero to mr lethem s bohemian parents i didn t make multiple copies to sell or anything ù he said it was more like i was collecting my own weird artifacts from a pretend universe where man was a real comic ù mr lethem swiped this sticker after stumbling on a shoot for the 1979 movie the warriors ù in the subway station in brooklyn which was standing in for the times square station this was my subway stop and the fact that they were turning it into 42nd street seemed absurd ù mr lethem recalled i remember thinking that no one would see or hear about this movie nothing that anyone was shooting in my neighborhood could possibly be important ù the archive contains typescripts of his novels often affixed with alternate titles would motherless brooklyn ù have been a hit if it had been called jerks from nowhere ù the earliest is apes in the plan ù an unpublished fake philip k dick novel ù as mr lethem put it named for a devo lyric and written between ages 18 and 23 i wrote three novels on an electric typewriter ù he said if i live long enough i could end up being one of the last living humans who can say that ù this diary tracking his writing progress social interactions exercise and um digestion comes from the when mr lethem had dropped out of bennington college and moved to berkeley calif to try to become a writer i had thrust myself into a kind of vacuum ù he said i had no visible means of support nor was anyone expecting to hear from me this kind of weird probably had to do with externalizing my superego and answering the question who are you and what did you actually do today ù about those drawings of vomiting cats for about 15 years every time i had a really good dance party that went late with people lolling around drunk and exhausted at about 2 a m i would hand out paper and ask everyone to draw a vomiting cat ù mr lethem said i ended up with an incredibly thick file of drawings some by people who went on to be published cartoonists and writers ù some of the goofy character names in mr lethem s novels are drawn from lists he typed up early in his career a habit he connects with the wordplay of motherless brooklyn ù whose narrator has tourette s syndrome mr lethem recalled a moment of recognition sparked by an oliver sacks essay about a surgeon with tourette s who kept a list of more than 200 unusual names as candy for the mind ù he was collecting real names ù mr lethem said but when i read that i thought oh my god that s me ù names from this list showed up in gun with occasional music ù 1994 and chronic city ù 2009 the fortress of solitude ù inspired by mr lethem s brooklyn childhood describes a store called samuel j underberg a site of mysterious life ù where graffiti artists came to buy ink that was specially formulated for stamping prices on slimy packages of meat and therefore ideal for tagging while writing mr lethem acquired some random items from the real underberg s now demolished which are shown here with a 1978 billboard hot 100 list an old calendar and other research materials i became a collector of all this tawdry used signage ù he said i just thought it was really weird and cool ù the archive contains dozens of letters from fellow writers and artists including donna tartt paul auster suzanne vega jennifer egan thomas berger and ursula k le guin this missive written on an airline safety card is from the novelist david bowman who died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 2012 all his letters were like mail art ù mr lethem said david had a great crazy brain he never stopped covering the world in language ù
