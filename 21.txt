when the green bay packers lost to the washington redskins in week 11 dropping to aaron rodgers vowed to run the table ù in a march to the playoffs with a victory over the detroit lions on sunday night the team fulfilled rodgers promise much of the drama of the matchup between division rivals was eliminated earlier in the day when the redskins lost to the giants thus guaranteeing both the packers and lions would be playoff teams but the n f c north bragging rights and a home game in the first round of the playoffs were sufficient motivation for green bay to push hard enough to secure the team s sixth consecutive win and the third consecutive loss for detroit pundits had spent the week deciphering all of the wild scenarios that could play out for positioning among the remaining teams but when all was said and done ten of the teams that were in line for a playoff spot remained in the same seeding order no 6 detroit lions at no 3 seattle seahawks time 8 15 p m eastern saturday on nbc the seahawks title hopes took a crushing blow when earl thomas was lost for the season with a broken leg after the injury the seahawks went with the wins coming with major asterisks as they came against the rams and 49ers that collapse paled in comparison to the lions who lost their final three games blowing what had been a large division lead against green bay line seahawks 43 no 5 giants at no 4 green bay packers time 4 40 p m eastern sunday on fox thanks to playing in the n f c east home of the dallas cowboys the giants managed to tie atlanta for the record in the n f c but got stuck with the no 5 seed in the playoffs and a road game against a packers squad that won its final six games the good news for the giants is that superstitious fans will note that the last two times they played the packers on the road in the playoffs they not only won the games but went on to win the super bowl both times line packers 44 5 bye weeks dallas atlanta no 5 oakland raiders at no 4 houston texans time 4 35 p m eastern saturday on espn line texans 37 the texans were the least inspiring of the n f l s division champions and that was complicated further when tom savage whom the team had elevated to starting quarterback after the benching of brock osweiler was forced to leave week 17 s loss to tennessee with a concussion as bad as that sounds it may still be enough against a reeling oakland squad that lost derek carr to a broken leg in week 16 matt mcgloin to a shoulder injury in week 17 and fell all the way from the no 2 seed in the a f c to no 5 it is unclear at this point if mcgloin or rookie connor cook will start at quarterback against houston no 6 miami dolphins at no 3 pittsburgh steelers time 1 05 p m eastern sunday on cbs the dolphins were a contender when the team s quarterback ryan tannehill was lost in week 14 with injured ligaments in his left knee thanks to backup quarterback matt moore and jay ajayi the team s running back they won two of three games and secured a berth but going up against a offense like pittsburgh is a tough test for miami s middling defense even if tannehill s knee heals enough to allow him to return line steelers 5 47 5 bye weeks new england kansas city with four teams vying for two n f c playoff spots all eyes were on the game on sunday a redskins victory could have caused movement in the seedings with the lions and packers playing a evening matchup the giants who had already locked up the no 5 seed and had nothing to gain threw a wrench in the redskins plans eliminating their division rivals with a decisive victory with the drama essentially taken out of the n f c all of the playoff movement sunday occurred in the a f c where there was a at the top of the standings in the a f c west just a week after losing derek carr the team s quarterback and a legitimate candidate for most valuable player to a broken leg the oakland raiders were crushed by the denver broncos that combined with the kansas city chiefs victory over the san diego chargers vaulted the chiefs from a spot all the way to the no 2 seed in the a f c which comes with a bye in the playoffs the loss for oakland added to the misery of the raiders who have gone from super bowl contenders last week to a team that will play on the road in houston next week potentially with a quarterback under center as carr s backup matt mcgloin injured his shoulder in the loss to the broncos beyond the switch to the chiefs as the no in the a f c it was business as usual for the teams that will get bye weeks in the playoffs the new england patriots secured the no 1 spot in the a f c with a win over miami the dallas cowboys were already guaranteed the no 1 spot in the n f c before their loss to philadelphia and the atlanta falcons held onto the no 2 seed in the n f c with a win over new orleans the only remaining chance for a minor was for the packers who led their division by virtue of a tiebreaker to lose to the lions which would have forced them to play on the road in the round of the playoffs but the aspect of the de facto n f c north championship went away when the redskins lost to the giants which eliminated the redskins from contention while most of the races were straight forward one of the crazier playoff scenarios that had been discussed before the week was the possibility that the tampa bay buccaneers could find themselves in the playoffs they simply had to shoot the moon by beating the carolina panthers having the redskins tie the giants the packers lose to the lions and should all of that happen they simply required wins by indianapolis dallas tennessee and san francisco to top the packers in strength of schedule tampa bay took care of their end by beating the panthers early in the day but they were eliminated officially when dallas lost to philadelphia
