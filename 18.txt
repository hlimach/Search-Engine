mumbai india it was a bold and risky gamble by prime minister narendra modi of india that quickly seemed to backfire the announcement of a ban on the largest currency bills circulating in india which came into full effect at midnight friday the last day for depositing the old notes at banks set off cash shortages that have hit the country s most vulnerable people hard and prompted worries about the economy but despite those concerns as well as doubts about whether the currency ban will reduce corruption as it is designed to do for the moment at least mr modi s bet appears to be paying off in the public arena even as the poorest indians have struggled many have continued to voice support for the prime minister s initiative to target the vast amounts of untaxed money known as black money ù flowing through the country s economy in hopes that it will combat an endemic culture of corruption mr modi analysts say has successfully tapped into deep frustration with the corruption that pervades almost every public interface with government even though the cash ban has produced enormous hardship for me and my family i support what mr modi is doing for our country ù said hem raj chechi 39 a taxi driver in new delhi the capital who said business had been down 50 percent since the ban was announced mr chechi has not been able to pay his children s school fees or send money back to his village to support them for nearly two months but he said we need to fight black money even though it is hurting little people like me ù mr modi came to power as a disruptive force pledging to overturn the status quo in new delhi bring jobs and fight corruption indians have repeatedly taken to the streets in recent years to demand an end to corruption widely seen as being most detrimental to the poor and powerless declaring war on corruption mr modi announced on nov 8 that 500 and 1 000 rupee bills worth about $8 and $15 would be banned the next morning with the currency ban mr modi has managed to convince many disaffected indians that he is on their side he has also used his powerful skills as a communicator to persuade people like mr chechi that the pain stemming from the ban is for the good that frustration with a political and business elite viewed by many as corrupt is what drove many americans to vote for donald j trump last year said eswar s prasad an economics professor at cornell university who is a native of india trump made the case that only he could effect change by blowing up the system ù mr prasad said in an interview modi in the same way did have a persuasive narrative that small changes at the margins can t tackle problems like corruption we needed big and painful changes really disruptive ones ù mr modi appeared on television on new year s eve to tell indians he understood their pain and urge them to bear with him in the aim of creating a better nation he compared his cash ban to the freedom struggle led by mohandas k gandhi a battle of good versus evil today mahatma gandhi is not among us but the path that was truth that he showed us is still most appropriate ù mr modi said using the honorific for gandhi as we begin the centenary year of the satyagraha ù he said referring to gandhi s nonviolent resistance movement let us recall the mahatma and resolve to follow his message of truth and goodness ù mr modi was presiding over one of the major economies in the world when he announced the ban on the rupee notes which made up 86 percent of the money in circulation it s a little bit crazy ù said geng xiao a professor of finance and public policy at the university of hong kong when i first read the news i couldn t even figure out if it was true ù the government said that people depositing large amounts of old currency more than 250 000 rupees or about $3 670 could be asked to prove that they had paid taxes on it some saw vast amounts of untaxed holdings suddenly rendered worthless whether mr modi s move will actually reduce corruption is a matter of debate some economists believe it could pave the way for other measures intended to discourage bribery or restructure the economy but others say the currency ban is unlikely to result in a significant reduction in corruption even as it has inconvenienced hundreds of millions of people who have struggled to get enough cash to meet their daily needs while the government tries to print enough new notes to replace the banned ones and a country short of cash has been unable to spend it which is likely to reduce economic growth in the short term economists say people living on the edge of poverty have been hit hard their diets and livelihoods severely affected many in india see mr modi who has also had success persuading parliament to clear the way for a unified tax to make it easier to ship and sell things across state lines as living up to his promise to be a reformer of india s ossified and bureaucratic economy but in the process he has placed the indian economy and his political future at risk many economists believe that the indian economy will take at least a hit because of a dire shortage of cash and that the future impact is uncertain if the effects are prolonged the public support for modi could wane if this move damages the economy he s in for a rough ride ù said harsh pant the head of strategic studies at the observer research foundation a new delhi think tank mr xiao said that in a system in which the informal sector is substantial the economy could be expected to experience a shock when so much cash is suddenly taken out you need offsetting stimulus policies to keep the economy growing ù he said mr modi was elected by an overwhelming majority in 2014 defeating the government led by the indian national congress party that had ruled for most of the country s life on the promise of bringing development and jobs and reducing corruption in 2014 he had presented himself as the big disrupter ù mr pant said he was the precursor to what s happening in the west ù mr modi was then the chief minister of the state of gujarat where he had a reputation for tearing away the country s red tape so businesses could set up shop and expand but during his first two years after winning national election mr modi whose party did not control the upper house of parliament struggled to achieve a significant economic overhaul mr modi changed the political narrative in 2016 as he successfully fought to get parliament to clear the way for the simplified tax he cast the opposition as people who don t want change who don t want reform ù mr pant said forcing them in august to support the changes but the challenges facing mr modi remain considerable seven weeks after the cash ban began to be put in place the currency shortage remains acute leading to a sharp drop in demand for services and earnings many providers said nagender tiwari 42 a rickshaw driver in east delhi said he was earning only 60 percent of the 1 000 rupees or about $15 that he used to take home daily before the cash ban as a result his family which includes two children in 11th grade has reduced its consumption of fish and meat they have been unable to pay the rent on their home he said he said he was skeptical about whether the ban was reducing corruption noting that he continued to be stopped by traffic police officers who extorted bribes so if bribery is not stopped how can black money be stopped ù he asked raj kumar bindal 65 a paper trader in new delhi said sales that plummeted to nearly nothing in the days after the cash ban had returned to about half of what they were before we can t shift to a cashless mode overnight ù he said surjit bhalla a new economic adviser for the observatory group in new york said he believed mr modi was likely to enact several other major changes in the coming months possibly including a move to a simplified personal income tax india needs to reduce the incentives for taxpayers to cheat mr bhalla said in the united states for every $100 collected in income tax an estimated $20 owed is not paid he added in india for that same $100 in taxes paid $200 more is owed he said collectively the cash ban and other anticorruption initiatives have the potential to transform india mr pant and others said but doing so depends on mr modi s continuing to command the political narrative of the country as he has so successfully done since instituting the cash ban so far he has taken control of the narrative and the people are with him ù mr pant said he thinks he can continue to do it but we really don t know there are so many unknowns ù
