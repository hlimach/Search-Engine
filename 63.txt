charleston s c seeming to abdicate one of his last chances to save his own life the convicted killer dylann s roof stood on wednesday before the jurors who will decide his fate and offered no apology no explanation and no remorse for massacring nine black churchgoers during a bible study session in june 2015 instead in a strikingly brief opening statement in the sentencing phase of his federal death penalty trial mr roof repeatedly assured the jury that he was not mentally ill undercutting one of the few mitigating factors that could work in his favor and left it at that other than the fact that i trust people that i shouldn t and the fact that i m probably better at constantly embarrassing myself than anyone who s ever existed there s nothing wrong with me psychologically ù mr roof who is representing himself told the jury which found him guilty last month of the killings at charleston s emanuel african methodist episcopal church three minutes after walking to the lectern mr roof returned to the defense table exhaling deeply any prospects for mercy by the jury had perhaps already been drained by the prosecution s disclosure in its opening statement of a white supremacist manifesto written by mr roof in the charleston county jail sometime in the six weeks after his arrest i would like to make it crystal clear i do not regret what i did ù he wrote in his distinctive scrawl i am not sorry i have not shed a tear for the innocent people i killed ù mr roof who was then 21 continued i do feel sorry for the innocent white children forced to live in this sick country and i do feel sorry for the innocent white people that are killed daily at the hands of the lower race i have shed a tear of for myself i feel pity that i had to do what i did in the first place i feel pity that i had to give up my life because of a situation that should never have existed ù as the government laid out its case for a death sentence the prosecutor who read from the journal nathan s williams an assistant united states attorney told the jury of 10 women and two men that mr roof s deadly rampage was a premeditated act that had devastated the families of his victims the defendant didn t stop after shooting one person or two or four or five he killed nine people ù mr williams said a few moments before he declared the death penalty is justified ù later aided by a slide show he described each of the victims and their lives setting the stage for several days of testimony by family members and friends of the victims mr williams emphasized that mr roof was capable of remorse and regret reminding jurors that he had left his mother a note of apology but only for the pain he knew his actions would cause his own family the presentations were a startling beginning to the trial s sentencing phase which is expected to run into next week in federal district court on dec 15 after six days of testimony in which defense lawyers did not contest his guilt the jury found mr roof guilty of 33 counts including hate crimes obstruction of religion resulting in death and firearms charges eighteen of those counts require the jury to decide whether to sentence mr roof now 22 to death or life in prison without the possibility of parole to impose a death sentence jurors must unanimously find that aggravating factors like premeditation and the number and vulnerability of the victims outweigh any mitigating factors like the absence of prior violent behavior and demonstrations of redemption and remorse mr roof is also facing a death penalty trial in state court although many people in the courtroom had already heard mr roof s flat monotone during the guilt phase when prosecutors played a video recording of his confession to f b i agents his statement on wednesday was his first to the jury mr roof chose to allow his legal team to represent him during the guilt phase but sidelined them during the penalty proceedings to prevent them from introducing any evidence regarding his family background or mental capacity the point is that i m not going to lie to you not by myself or through somebody else ù mr roof told the jury as his paternal grandparents watched from the second row on the left side of the courtroom several women on the right side which is reserved for victims family members left their seats one of them muttering curses mr roof has said he does not plan to call witnesses or present evidence on his behalf and he did not any of the prosecution s witnesses on wednesday his approach stands in sharp contrast to the strategy of justice department lawyers who have said they may call more than 30 witnesses including at least one survivor of the attack family members of the victims and federal law enforcement officials prosecutors began wednesday with the widow of the rev clementa c pinckney the church s slain pastor and his two best friends jennifer benjamin pinckney who was married to mr pinckney for 15 years narrated an affectionate and often lighthearted telling of their life together illustrated by dozens of photographs of her husband as a young saxophone player in a school band attending the births of their two daughters vacationing on caribbean cruises and on a trip to seattle she described him as a preacher who extended his ministry as a voice for the voiceless ù to his work in the south carolina legislature where he served first in the house and then the senate often exhausted by his dual roles he was depicted in several pictures as having fallen asleep in the back seat of the family car and on a couch while reading to his daughters he was the person that i think every mom would be happy that her daughter would marry ù ms pinckney a school librarian said he was that great catch ù ms pinckney also described her terror on the night of june 17 2015 as she and the couple s younger daughter malana then 6 listened to the gunfire from their hiding place beneath a desk in her husband s study as her husband and the others were gunned down in the adjacent church fellowship hall ms pinckney struggled to keep her daughter quiet and still i was just like shh shh shh ù ms pinckney said and i put my hand over her mouth and she was holding on to me and she put her hand on my mouth ù mama is daddy going to die ù her daughter asked ms pinckney said she said the hardest thing she had ever done was telling her two daughters early the next morning that their father had been killed ms pinckney said she had heard mr roof try to open the door to the study which she had locked when the shooting began another assistant united states attorney julius n richardson asked why she thought she had been spared it wasn t my time ù ms pinckney answered i couldn t see god taking both parents away from two small kids ù the rev kylon middleton an a m e minister who had known mr pinckney from childhood described his lifelong friend as immensely precocious he began preaching at 13 and strategically ambitious he aspired to be both a bishop and perhaps the state s first governor in addition to mr pinckney the victims were the rev depayne middleton doctor 49 cynthia hurd 54 susie jackson 87 ethel lee lance 70 tywanza sanders 26 the rev daniel lee simmons sr 74 the rev sharonda 45 and myra thompson 59 near the end of the day ms thompson s widower the rev anthony b thompson the vicar of a reformed episcopal church here told jurors about their marriage their anniversary date to a beach his wife s determined demeanor and her commitment to the historic congregation in testimony that was mixed with laughter and tears mr thompson recounted their final day together as she prepared for the evening study of the gospel of mark she had her glow ù he said i mean this smile on her face she was radiant i just kept looking at her ù word of a shooting came hours later and mr thompson rushed to the church he demanded to know whether she had been injured or killed he eventually found out my whole world was gone ù he said i literally did not know what to do everything i did was for her and she was gone what am i here for if she s gone what am i here for ù
