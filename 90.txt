washington when special agent adrian hawkins of the federal bureau of investigation called the democratic national committee in september 2015 to pass along some troubling news about its computer network he was transferred naturally to the help desk his message was brief if alarming at least one computer system belonging to the d n c had been compromised by hackers federal investigators had named the dukes ù a cyberespionage team linked to the russian government the f b i knew it well the bureau had spent the last few years trying to kick the dukes out of the unclassified email systems of the white house the state department and even the joint chiefs of staff one of the government s networks yared tamene the contractor at the d n c who fielded the call was no expert in cyberattacks his first moves were to check google for the dukes ù and conduct a cursory search of the d n c computer system logs to look for hints of such a cyberintrusion by his own account he did not look too hard even after special agent hawkins called back repeatedly over the next several weeks in part because he wasn t certain the caller was a real f b i agent and not an impostor i had no way of differentiating the call i just received from a prank call ù mr tamene wrote in an internal memo obtained by the new york times that detailed his contact with the f b i it was the cryptic first sign of a cyberespionage and campaign devised to disrupt the 2016 presidential election the first such attempt by a foreign power in american history what started as an operation intelligence officials believe ultimately morphed into an effort to harm one candidate hillary clinton and tip the election to her opponent donald j trump like another famous american election scandal it started with a at the d n c the first time 44 years ago at the committee s old offices in the watergate complex the burglars planted listening devices and jimmied a filing cabinet this time the burglary was conducted from afar directed by the kremlin with emails and zeros and ones an examination by the times of the russian operation based on interviews with dozens of players targeted in the attack intelligence officials who investigated it and obama administration officials who deliberated over the best response reveals a series of missed signals slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of the cyberattack the d n c s fumbling encounter with the f b i meant the best chance to halt the russian intrusion was lost the failure to grasp the scope of the attacks undercut efforts to minimize their impact and the white house s reluctance to respond forcefully meant the russians have not paid a heavy price for their actions a decision that could prove critical in deterring future cyberattacks the approach of the f b i meant that russian hackers could roam freely through the committee s network for nearly seven months before top d n c officials were alerted to the attack and hired cyberexperts to protect their systems in the meantime the hackers moved on to targets outside the d n c including mrs clinton s campaign chairman john d podesta whose private email account was hacked months later even mr podesta a savvy washington insider who had written a 2014 report on cyberprivacy for president obama did not truly understand the gravity of the hacking by last summer democrats watched in helpless fury as their private emails and confidential documents appeared online day after day procured by russian intelligence agents posted on wikileaks and other websites then eagerly reported on by the american media including the times mr trump gleefully cited many of the purloined emails on the campaign trail the fallout included the resignations of representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida the chairwoman of the d n c and most of her top party aides leading democrats were sidelined at the height of the campaign silenced by revelations of embarrassing emails or consumed by the scramble to deal with the hacking though by the public confidential documents taken by the russian hackers from the d n c s sister organization the democratic congressional campaign committee turned up in congressional races in a dozen states tainting some of them with accusations of scandal in recent days a skeptical the nation s intelligence agencies and the two major parties have become embroiled in an extraordinary public dispute over what evidence exists that president vladimir v putin of russia moved beyond mere espionage to deliberately try to subvert american democracy and pick the winner of the presidential election many of mrs clinton s closest aides believe that the russian assault had a profound impact on the election while conceding that other factors mrs clinton s weaknesses as a candidate her private email server the public statements of the f b i director james b comey about her handling of classified information were also important while there s no way to be certain of the ultimate impact of the hack this much is clear a weapon that russia had in elections from ukraine to europe was trained on the united states with devastating effectiveness for russia with an enfeebled economy and a nuclear arsenal it cannot use short of war cyberpower proved the perfect weapon cheap hard to see coming hard to trace there shouldn t be any doubt in anybody s mind ù adm michael s rogers the director of the national security agency and commander of united states cyber command said at a postelection conference this was not something that was done casually this was not something that was done by chance this was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily ù he said this was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific effect ù for the people whose emails were stolen this new form of political sabotage has left a trail of shock and professional damage neera tanden president of the center for american progress and a key clinton supporter recalls walking into the busy clinton transition offices humiliated to see her face on television screens as pundits discussed a leaked email in which she had called mrs clinton s instincts suboptimal ù it was just a sucker punch to the gut every day ù ms tanden said it was the worst professional experience of my life ù the united states too has carried out cyberattacks and in decades past the c i a tried to subvert foreign elections but the russian attack is increasingly understood across the political spectrum as an ominous historic landmark with one notable exception mr trump has rejected the findings of the intelligence agencies he will soon oversee as ridiculous ù insisting that the hacker may be american or chinese but that they have no idea ù mr trump cited the reported disagreements between the agencies about whether mr putin intended to help elect him on tuesday a russian government spokesman echoed mr trump s scorn this tale of hacks resembles a banal brawl between american security officials over spheres of influence ù maria zakharova the spokeswoman for the russian foreign ministry wrote on facebook over the weekend four prominent senators two republicans and two democrats joined forces to pledge an investigation while pointedly ignoring mr trump s skeptical claims democrats and republicans must work together and across the jurisdictional lines of the congress to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks ù said senators john mccain lindsey graham chuck schumer and jack reed this cannot become a partisan issue ù they said the stakes are too high for our country ù sitting in the basement of the democratic national committee headquarters below a 2012 portrait of a smiling barack obama is a filing cabinet missing the handle on the bottom drawer only a framed newspaper story hanging on the wall hints at the importance of this aged piece of office furniture gop security aide among 5 arrested in bugging affair ù reads the headline from the front page of the washington post on june 19 1972 with the bylines of bob woodward and carl bernstein andrew brown 37 the technology director at the d n c was born after that famous but as he began to plan for this year s election cycle he was well aware that the d n c could become a target again there were aspirations to ensure that the d n c was well protected against cyberintruders and then there was the reality mr brown and his bosses at the organization acknowledged the d n c was a nonprofit group dependent on donations with a fraction of the security budget that a corporation its size would have there was never enough money to do everything we needed to do ù mr brown said the d n c had a standard email service intended to block phishing attacks and malware created to resemble legitimate email but when russian hackers started in on the d n c the committee did not have the most advanced systems in place to track suspicious traffic internal d n c memos show mr tamene who reports to mr brown and fielded the call from the f b i agent was not a d n c employee he works for a contracting firm called the mis department he was left to figure out largely on his own how to respond and even whether the man who had called in to the d n c switchboard was really an f b i agent the f b i thinks the d n c has at least one compromised computer on its network and the f b i wanted to know if the d n c is aware and if so what the d n c is doing about it ù mr tamene wrote in an internal memo about his contacts with the f b i he added that the special agent told me to look for a specific type of malware dubbed dukes by the u s intelligence community and in cybersecurity circles ù part of the problem was that special agent hawkins did not show up in person at the d n c nor could he email anyone there as that risked alerting the hackers that the f b i knew they were in the system mr tamene s initial scan of the d n c system using his tools and incomplete targeting information from the f b i found nothing so when special agent hawkins called repeatedly in october leaving voice mail messages for mr tamene urging him to call back i did not return his calls as i had nothing to report ù mr tamene explained in his memo in november special agent hawkins called with more ominous news a d n c computer was calling home where home meant russia ù mr tamene s memo says referring to software sending information to moscow sa hawkins added that the f b i thinks that this calling home behavior could be the result of a attack ù mr brown knew that mr tamene who declined to comment was fielding calls from the f b i but he was tied up on a different problem evidence suggesting that the campaign of senator bernie sanders of vermont mrs clinton s main democratic opponent had improperly gained access to her campaign data ms wasserman schultz then the d n c s chairwoman and amy dacey then its chief executive said in interviews that neither of them was notified about the early reports that the committee s system had likely been compromised shawn henry who once led the f b i s cyber division and is now president of crowdstrike services the cybersecurity firm retained by the d n c in april said he was baffled that the f b i did not call a more senior official at the d n c or send an agent in person to the party headquarters to try to force a more vigorous response we are not talking about an office that is in the middle of the woods of montana ù mr henry said we are talking about an office that is half a mile from the f b i office that is getting the notification ù this is not a delicatessen or a local library this is a critical piece of the u s infrastructure because it relates to our electoral process our elected officials our legislative process our executive process ù he added to me it is a serious issue and if after a couple of months you don t see any results somebody ought to raise that to a higher level ù the f b i declined to comment on the agency s handling of the hack the f b i takes very seriously any compromise of public and private sector systems ù it said in a statement adding that agents will continue to share information ù to help targets safeguard their systems against the actions of persistent cybercriminals ù by march mr tamene and his team had met at least twice in person with the f b i and concluded that agent hawkins was really a federal employee but then the situation took a dire turn a second team of hackers began to target the d n c and other players in the political world particularly democrats billy rinehart a former d n c regional field director who was then working for mrs clinton s campaign got an odd email warning from google someone just used your password to try to sign into your google account ù the march 22 email said adding that the attempt had occurred in ukraine google stopped this attempt you should change your password immediately ù mr rinehart was in hawaii at the time he remembers checking his email at 4 a m for messages from east coast associates without thinking much about the notification he clicked on the change password ù button and half asleep as best he can remember he typed in a new password what he did not know until months later is that he had just given the russian hackers access to his email account hundreds of similar phishing emails were being sent to american political targets including an identical email sent on march 19 to mr podesta chairman of the clinton campaign given how many emails mr podesta received through this personal email account several aides also had access to it and one of them noticed the warning email sending it to a computer technician to make sure it was legitimate before anyone clicked on the change password ù button this is a legitimate email ù charles delavan a clinton campaign aide replied to another of mr podesta s aides who had noticed the alert john needs to change his password immediately ù with another click a decade of emails that mr podesta maintained in his gmail account a total of about 60 000 were unlocked for the russian hackers mr delavan in an interview said that his bad advice was a result of a typo he knew this was a phishing attack as the campaign was getting dozens of them he said he had meant to type that it was an illegitimate ù email an error that he said has plagued him ever since during this second wave the hackers also gained access to the democratic congressional campaign committee and then through a virtual private network connection to the main computer network of the d n c the f b i observed this surge of activity as well again reaching out to mr tamene to warn him yet mr tamene still saw no reason to be alarmed he found copies of the phishing emails in the d n c s spam filter but he had no reason he said to believe that the computer systems had been infiltrated one bit of progress had finally been made by the middle of april the d n c seven months after it had first been warned finally installed a robust set of monitoring tools ù mr tamene s internal memo says the united states had two decades of warning that russia s intelligence agencies were trying to break into america s most sensitive computer networks but the russians have always managed to stay a step ahead their first major attack was detected on oct 7 1996 when a computer operator at the colorado school of mines discovered some nighttime computer activity he could not explain the school had a major contract with the navy and the operator warned his contacts there but as happened two decades later at the d n c at first everyone was unable to connect the dots ù said thomas rid a scholar at king s college in london who has studied the attack investigators gave it a name moonlight maze and spent two years often working day and night tracing how it hopped from the navy to the department of energy to the air force and nasa in the end they concluded that the total number of files stolen if printed and stacked would be taller than the washington monument whole weapons designs were flowing out the door and it was a first taste of what was to come an escalating campaign of cyberattacks around the world but for years the russians stayed largely out of the headlines thanks to the chinese who took bigger risks and often got caught they stole the designs for the fighter jet corporate secrets for rolling steel even the blueprints for gas pipelines that supply much of the united states and during the 2008 presidential election cycle chinese intelligence hacked into the campaigns of mr obama and mr mccain making off with internal position papers and communications but they didn t publish any of it the russians had not gone away of course they were just a lot more stealthy ù said kevin mandia a former air force intelligence officer who spent most of his days fighting off russian cyberattacks before founding mandiant a cybersecurity firm that is now a division of fireeye and the company the clinton campaign brought in to secure its own systems the russians were also quicker to turn their attacks to political purposes a 2007 cyberattack on estonia a former soviet republic that had joined nato sent a message that russia could paralyze the country without invading it the next year cyberattacks were used during russia s war with georgia but american officials did not imagine that the russians would dare try those techniques inside the united states they were largely focused on preventing what former defense secretary leon e panetta warned was an approaching cyber pearl harbor ù a shutdown of the power grid or cellphone networks but in 2014 and 2015 a russian hacking group began systematically targeting the state department the white house and the joint chiefs of staff each time they eventually met with some form of success ù michael sulmeyer a former cyberexpert for the secretary of defense and ben buchanan now both of the harvard cyber security project wrote recently in a published paper for the carnegie endowment the russians grew stealthier and stealthier tricking government computers into sending out data while disguising the electronic command and control ù messages that set off alarms for anyone looking for malicious actions the state department was so crippled that it repeatedly closed its systems to throw out the intruders at one point officials traveling to vienna with secretary of state john kerry for the iran nuclear negotiations had to set up commercial gmail accounts just to communicate with one another and with reporters traveling with them mr obama was briefed regularly on all this but he made a decision that many in the white house now regret he did not name russians publicly or issue sanctions there was always a reason fear of escalating a cyberwar and concern that the united states needed russia s cooperation in negotiations over syria we d have all these circular meetings ù one senior state department official said in which everyone agreed you had to push back at the russians and push back hard but it didn t happen ù so the russians escalated again breaking into systems not just for espionage but to publish or broadcast what they found known as doxing ù in the cyberworld it was a brazen change in tactics moving the russians from espionage to influence operations in february 2014 they broadcast an intercepted phone call between victoria nuland the assistant secretary of state who handles russian affairs and has a contentious relationship with mr putin and geoffrey pyatt the united states ambassador to ukraine ms nuland was heard describing a american effort to broker a deal in ukraine then in political turmoil they were not the only ones on whom the russians used the strategy the open society foundation run by george soros was a major target and when its documents were released some turned out to have been altered to make it appear as if the foundation was financing russian opposition members last year the attacks became more aggressive russia hacked a major french television station frying critical hardware around christmas it attacked part of the power grid in ukraine dropping a portion of the country into darkness killing backup generators and taking control of generators in retrospect it was a warning shot the attacks were not fully integrated military operations ù mr sulmeyer said but they showed an increasing boldness the day before the white house correspondents association dinner in april ms dacey the d n c s chief executive was preparing for a night of parties when she got an urgent phone call with the new monitoring system in place mr tamene had examined administrative logs of the d n c s computer system and found something very suspicious an unauthorized person with security status had gained access to the d n c s computers not sure it is related to what the f b i has been noticing ù said one internal d n c email sent on april 29 the d n c may have been hacked in a serious way this week with password theft etc ù no one knew just how bad the breach was but it was clear that a lot more than a single filing cabinet worth of materials might have been taken a secret committee was immediately created including ms dacey ms wasserman schultz mr brown and michael sussmann a former cybercrimes prosecutor at the department of justice who now works at perkins coie the washington law firm that handles d n c political matters three most important questions ù mr sussmann wrote to his clients the night the was confirmed 1 what data was accessed 2 how was it done 3 how do we stop it ù mr sussmann instructed his clients not to use d n c email because they had just one opportunity to lock the hackers out an effort that could be foiled if the hackers knew that the d n c was on to them you only get one chance to raise the drawbridge ù mr sussmann said if the adversaries know you are aware of their presence they will take steps to burrow in or erase the logs that show they were present ù the d n c immediately hired crowdstrike a cybersecurity firm to scan its computers identify the intruders and build a new computer and telephone system from scratch within a day crowdstrike confirmed that the intrusion had originated in russia mr sussmann said the work that such companies do is a computer version of crime scene investigation with fingerprints bullet casings and dna swabs replaced by an electronic trail that can be just as incriminating and just as police detectives learn to identify the telltale methods of a veteran burglar so crowdstrike investigators recognized the distinctive handiwork of cozy bear and fancy bear those are crowdstrike s nicknames for the two russian hacking groups that the firm found at work inside the d n c network cozy bear the group also known as the dukes or a p t 29 for advanced persistent threat ù may or may not be associated with the f s b the main successor to the k g b but it is widely believed to be a russian government operation it made its first appearance in 2014 said dmitri alperovitch crowdstrike s and chief technology officer it was cozy bear crowdstrike concluded that first penetrated the d n c in the summer of 2015 by sending emails to a long list of american government agencies washington nonprofits and government contractors whenever someone clicked on a phishing message the russians would enter the network exfiltrate ù documents of interest and stockpile them for intelligence purposes once they got into the d n c they found the data valuable and decided to continue the operation ù said mr alperovitch who was born in russia and moved to the united states as a teenager only in march 2016 did fancy bear show up first penetrating the computers of the democratic congressional campaign committee and then jumping to the d n c investigators believe fancy bear sometimes called a p t 28 and believed to be directed by the g r u russia s military intelligence agency is an older outfit tracked by western investigators for nearly a decade it was fancy bear that got hold of mr podesta s email attribution as the skill of identifying a cyberattacker is known is more art than science it is often impossible to name an attacker with absolute certainty but over time by accumulating a reference library of hacking techniques and targets it is possible to spot repeat offenders fancy bear for instance has gone after military and political targets in ukraine and georgia and at nato installations that largely rules out cybercriminals and most countries mr alperovitch said there s no plausible actor that has an interest in all those victims other than russia ù he said another clue the russian hacking groups tended to be active during working hours in the moscow time zone to their astonishment mr alperovitch said crowdstrike experts found signs that the two russian hacking groups had not coordinated their attacks fancy bear apparently not knowing that cozy bear had been rummaging in d n c files for months took many of the same documents in the six weeks after crowdstrike s arrival in total secrecy the computer system at the d n c was replaced for a weekend email and phones were shut off employees were told it was a system upgrade all laptops were turned in and the hard drives wiped clean with the uninfected information on them imaged to new drives though d n c officials had learned that the democratic congressional campaign committee had been infected too they did not notify their sister organization which was in the same building because they were afraid that it would leak all of this work took place as the bitter contest for the democratic nomination continued to play out between mrs clinton and mr sanders and it was already causing a major distraction for ms wasserman schultz and the d n c s chief executive this was not a bump in the road bumps in the road happen all the time ù she said in an interview two different russian spy agencies had hacked into our network and stolen our property and we did not yet know what they had taken but we knew they had very broad access to our network there was a tremendous amount of uncertainty and it was chilling ù the d n c executives and their lawyer had their first formal meeting with senior f b i officials in nine months after the bureau s first call to the contractor among the early requests at that meeting according to participants that the federal government make a quick attribution ù formally blaming actors with ties to russian government for the attack to make clear that it was not routine hacking but foreign espionage you have a presidential election underway here and you know that the russians have hacked into the d n c ù mr sussmann said recalling the message to the f b i we need to tell the american public that and soon ù in on mr sussmann s advice d n c leaders decided to take a bold step concerned that word of the hacking might leak they decided to go public in the washington post with the news that the committee had been attacked that way they figured they could get ahead of the story win a little sympathy from voters for being victimized by russian hackers and refocus on the campaign but the very next day a new deeply unsettling shock awaited them someone calling himself guccifer 2 0 appeared on the web claiming to be the d n c hacker and he posted a confidential committee document detailing mr trump s record and half a dozen other documents to prove his bona fides and it s just a tiny part of all docs i downloaded from the democrats networks ù he wrote then something more ominous the main part of the papers thousands of files and mails i gave to wikileaks they will publish them soon ù it was bad enough that russian hackers had been spying inside the committee s network for months now the public release of documents had turned a conventional espionage operation into something far more menacing political sabotage an unpredictable uncontrollable menace for democratic campaigns guccifer 2 0 borrowed the moniker of an earlier hacker a romanian who called himself guccifer and was jailed for breaking into the personal computers of former president george w bush former secretary of state colin l powell and other notables this new attacker seemed intent on showing that the d n c s cyberexperts at crowdstrike were wrong to blame russia guccifer 2 0 called himself a lone hacker ù and mocked crowdstrike for calling the attackers sophisticated ù but online investigators quickly undercut his story on a whim lorenzo a writer for motherboard the tech and culture site of vice tried to contact guccifer 2 0 by direct message on twitter surprisingly he answered right away ù mr said but whoever was on the other end seemed to be mocking him i asked him why he did it and he said he wanted to expose the illuminati he called himself a gucci lover and he said he was romanian ù that gave mr an idea using google translate he sent the purported hacker some questions in romanian the answers came back in romanian but when he was offline mr checked with a couple of native speakers who told him guccifer 2 0 had apparently been using google translate as well and was clearly not the romanian he claimed to be cyberresearchers found other clues pointing to russia microsoft word documents posted by guccifer 2 0 had been edited by someone calling himself in russian felix edmundovich an obvious nom de guerre honoring the founder of the soviet secret police felix edmundovich dzerzhinsky bad links in the texts were marked by warnings in russian generated by what was clearly a version of word when mr managed to engage guccifer 2 0 over a period of weeks he found that his interlocutor s tone and manner changed at first he was careless and colloquial weeks later he was curt and more calculating ù he said it seemed like a group of people and a very sloppy attempt to cover up ù computer experts drew the same conclusion about dcleaks com a site that sprang up in june claiming to be the work of hacktivists ù but posting more stolen documents it too seemed to be a clumsy front for the same russians who had stolen the documents notably the website was registered in april suggesting that the russian hacking team planned well in advance to make public what it stole in addition to what guccifer 2 0 published on his site he provided material directly on request to some bloggers and publications the steady flow of guccifer 2 0 documents constantly undercut democratic messaging efforts on july 6 12 days before the republican national convention began in cleveland guccifer released the d n c s battle plan and budget for countering it for republican operatives it was insider gold then wikileaks a far more established outlet began to publish the hacked material just as guccifer 2 0 had promised on july 22 three days before the start of the democratic national convention in philadelphia wikileaks dumped out 44 053 d n c emails with 17 761 attachments some of the messages made clear that some d n c officials favored mrs clinton over her progressive challenger mr sanders
