finally the second avenue subway opened in new york city on sunday with thousands of riders flooding into its polished stations to witness a piece of history nearly a century in the making they descended beneath the streets of the upper east side of manhattan to board q trains bound for coney island in brooklyn they cheered their eyes filled with tears they snapped selfies in front of colorful mosaics lining the walls of the stations it was the first day of 2017 and it felt like a new day for a city that for so long struggled to build this sorely needed subway line in a rare display of unbridled optimism from hardened new yorkers they arrived with huge grins and wide eyes taking in the bells and whistles at three new stations i was very choked up ù betsy morris 70 said as she rode the first train to leave the 96th street station at noon how do you explain something that you never thought would happen it s going to change the way everybody lives as far as commuting goes ù it was a major moment for new york s sprawling transit system after decades of failed efforts to bring the line to one of the few corners of manhattan the subway did not reach the opening of the first segment of the line an extension of the q train to 96th street promises to lighten the crush of passengers on the nos 4 5 and 6 trains along lexington avenue the nation s most overcrowded subway line which had been the only line on the upper east side of manhattan when the stations opened shortly before noon they were quickly filled with giddy riders both young and old and strollers suitcases and dogs all familiar sights across the system but for all the excitement the line with just three new stops is much more modest than the ambitious route running the length of manhattan that was once envisioned it serves a relatively affluent and not very diverse part of the city which has more than eight and a half million people and many and minority residents who live far from a subway line with the subway reaching its highest ridership levels since 1948 much of the aging system is plagued by crowding and delays even as subway and bus fares are expected to rise again in march still there was reason to cheer the opening of a new subway line is a rare occasion in the united states and comes at a time of mounting concern about the deteriorating state of the nation s infrastructure from its roadways and bridges to its public transit systems few new subway stations have opened in recent years even as expansive subway networks have sprouted in asia and most american cities never built any in the first place the major subways in the northeast in new york washington and boston are grappling with old equipment and funding shortfalls with washington experiencing a near meltdown over safety problems with mounting bills for basic maintenance these subways have largely failed to grow so the arrival of the second avenue subway which was first proposed in the 1920s was a notable achievement for the metropolitan transportation authority which runs the city s vast network of subways buses and commuter railroads the first phase of the project took nearly a decade to build and cost about $4 4 billion with the opening the map of the city s loved and loathed subway adds three new stations bringing the total to 472 the most of any subway in the world a station that opened at hudson yards on manhattan s far west side in 2015 was the city s first new station in a on sunday new yorkers were mesmerized by the artwork adorning the walls at the 72nd street stop sumana harihareswara stopped to gaze at a mosaic of a woman of south asian descent dressed in a burgundy sari looking at her cellphone ms harihareswara was overcome with emotion i don t think i ve ever come across subway art before that makes me feel so seen ù she said through tears this woman could be my aunt she could be my cousin ù she and a stranger exchanged a knowing glance representation matters ù they agreed ms harihareswara a longtime transit enthusiast from astoria queens said she was struck by the diversity portrayed in the mosaics including a mural of a gay couple holding hands there is no feeling quite like seeing yourself cemented into the infrastructure of new york ù ms harihareswara said after decades of aborted efforts to build the second avenue line and at least three groundbreakings in the 1970s construction on the current segment began in 2007 the line was originally projected to open in 2013 but subway officials pushed the deadline to the end of 2016 many years ago gov andrew m cuomo a democrat who effectively controls the authority pressed officials to meet the december 2016 deadline even as concerns grew that the subway would not be ready in time still the agency made the deadline just barely with a lavish inaugural ride on new year s eve for a collection of dignitaries that culminated in a midnight toast although many new yorkers believe the city runs the subways it is actually the governor who appoints the authority s chairman and holds considerable sway over the agency mr cuomo has capitalized on the second avenue opening to raise his national profile overshadowing his frequent nemesis mayor bill de blasio a democrat who attended the inaugural ride on saturday but was not given a speaking slot despite general good will over the opening some transit advocates expressed concerns over the high cost of the project and questioned whether officials would move aggressively to extend the line to 125th street in east harlem as planned on sunday morning mr cuomo arrived at the 96th street station with the authority s chairman thomas f prendergast to join the first trip for regular riders who cheered as the train pulled out of the station then mr cuomo s voice came over the loudspeaker rest assured i m not driving the train ù he joked the first day of service was smooth although there were a few hiccups around 3 p m there were delays on the q line because of a train with mechanical problems at the city hall station about an hour earlier the elevator at the new 86th street stop had begun to malfunction stranding passengers above and below ground strollers were wheeled onto steep escalators parents became upset jill tallmer 62 and her mother margot tallmer 91 contemplated visiting another day we ve been waiting for 10 years or more to ride ù the younger ms tallmer said while standing with her mother a lifelong new yorker who is in a wheelchair hopefully it s almost ready for us ù it was not and they left after a few minutes at the 72nd street station george braith a jazz saxophonist was being mobbed by an eager pack of veritable paparazzi the reason for his newfound celebrity his likeness is featured in a mosaic there would you look at that guy ù mr braith 77 said pretty handsome fellow if you ask me ù he is one of several local celebrities portrayed in the artwork including chef daniel boulud in mr braith s mosaic he is clad in a slick red blazer and carrying his signature braithophone alto and soprano saxophones melded into one taking the instrument from his suitcase he obliged the crowd with a brief tune are you famous ù a asked seeing the hubbub in the jazz world ù mr braith replied the man shook his head and said well you re immortalized as far as i m concerned ù another celebrant ian ma 15 lives in sheepshead bay a waterfront neighborhood in southern brooklyn that is nowhere near the new subway line but he has been enchanted by trains since he started rolling toy models on the floor as a child he said and he cajoled his parents into giving him a ride i feel like i ve been waiting for this train my whole life ù he said seemingly speaking for many others
