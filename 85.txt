in the first episode of one day at a time ù netflix s reboot of the norman lear sitcom penelope justina machado has an argument with her son alex marcel ruiz who wants an expensive new pair of sneakers mom ù he says i know we re not rich but are we poor ù it s a casual line that sets up a joke penelope reminds alex that they have a tv a refrigerator and a laptop those are things poor people have ù he says but it s based on an acknowledgment you don t really hear in prime time anymore that there is a class divide nebulous but real and that your family is closer to the bad side of it the new one day at a time ù arriving on friday is lively and full of voice a rare reboot that s better than the original it s a throwback in the best sense to an era of mainstream socially engaged sitcoms and just as the political debate has pitted diversity against class in a contest it s a reminder that the two aren t mutually exclusive in the 1970s tv was full of characters living paycheck to paycheck whether cabbies taxi ù waitresses alice ù auto mechanics chico and the man ù or brewery workers laverne and shirley ù mr lear the sitcom maestro of the era produced a suite of shows like this all in the family ù good times ù sanford and son ù mr lear an populist liberal made tv about the little guy in part the programming reflected the economy of the time the average american wage peaked in 1973 and the middle class was broader but as income inequality began to grow in the 1980s and 90s tv like any neighborhood buffeted by market forces got gentrified advertising rates became increasingly tied to audience demographics which made poorer viewers less valuable basic cable fragmented the viewership more shows made for smaller niches and premium networks like hbo focused on series about the kind of people who could afford to pay for networks like hbo tv courted upscale audiences by showing them versions of themselves goodbye roseanne conner hello carrie bradshaw with few exceptions like abc s the middle ù sitcoms moved into offices cafes and living rooms populated by comfortably characters a recent ù slyly acknowledged this remove its affluent parents were mortified when their youngest son took an aptitude test that pegged him as a future skilled laborer ù work nonprofessional work became the stuff of reality tv deadliest catch ù just as actual labor became increasingly invisible to consumers shunted off overseas or hidden through people entered tv through the poor door or not at all with one day at a time ù like fuller house ù and gilmore girls ù another product of netflix s drive to exhume our every nostalgic memory peak tv is restoring something of what peak tv took away the kind of family that buys discounted meat at the grocery store and whose old car stalls when you turn on the the original one day at a time ù based on the whitney blake s experience as a divorced mother was lighter and more disposable than all in the family ù i still have warm memories of mackenzie phillips and valerie bertinelli duetting on don t go breaking my heart ù but let s not kid ourselves but it spoke to the times compared with mr lear s outspoken maude ann romano bonnie franklin expressed her feminism practically bouncing from job to job getting the rent paid and raising two independent girls this was in 1975 just five years after it was deemed too outrageous to have mary richards be divorced in the mary tyler moore show ù the update which mr lear produces with gloria calder√≥n kellett and mike royce moves the setting from indianapolis to echo park los angeles and reimagines the family as mr lear s remake of his own work recalls how he adapted the british steptoe and son ù as sanford and son ù with an cast gloria estefan reprises the theme song now syncopated there s a third generation a rita moreno as penelope s mother lydia the daughter elena isabella gomez a charmer is a school debate champ who sees her coming quincea√±era as a tool of the patriarchy the omnipresent apartment super schneider todd grinnell played in the original by pat harrington with a mustache that defined 70s is now a stubbly hipster whose dad owns the building the most productive rethinking involves penelope a veteran of afghanistan who works as a medical assistant the war ended her marriage she separated from her husband also a soldier who developed a drinking problem from stress and left her with anxiety and a bum shoulder the show understands in a way comedies about more privileged families don t have to that circumstances shape choices and exact costs despite the laughs the series works best in dramedy mode the season has a serial arc and ms machado previously of six feet under ù handles the emotional material with a light touch one of the strongest episodes is built around a long frustrating phone call with the department of veterans affairs as penelope tries to wrangle a chiropractor referral the humor is clunkier stephen tobolowsky carries some familiar workplace subplots as penelope s boss and the show leans heavily on ricky jokes about lydia s accent still if the comedy can be dated the retro approach multicamera theatrical feels current as the headlines recall the tumult of the 70s and the seems to be tweeting from archie bunker s armchair one of the season s themes immigration lands harder if differently from the way it might have before the election of course one sitcom can represent only so much scripted tv still neglects rural america though netflix has lately stepped into that gap with the ranch ù nbc s affable workplace sitcom superstore ù speaks to an economy that campaign rhetoric aside is more about service and retail jobs than about assembly lines maybe they ll have company soon abc for instance is talking about making its programming more after the election if efforts like this manage to find us the next roseanne ù that s all good but the new one day at a time ù which arrives while hispanic tv families are still a rarity also casually refutes the lazy postelection punditry that ù is a euphemism for white ù that there is an choice between the identity politics ù of representing the underrepresented and a focus on people s economic struggles if tv can help divided americans see one another better it s by telling more specific stories of every kind it s true that we don t see enough people on tv or military veterans or hispanic families and guess what sometimes this one day at a time ù reminds us you find all those people under the same roof
