it s that time of year when financial advice sites issue their lists of the stocks to buy for 2017 ù before you take them up on their suggestions let s look at how well such portfolios did in 2016 the portfolios of stocks they were telling you to buy generally did much worse than the stock market over all the results underline what many personal finance experts recommend invest in a broad mutual index fund the times s your money ù columnist wrote more on this here in 2016 the broad s p stock index increased 9 5 percent but if you invested in forbes s 2016 list your money grew about 7 percent kiplinger s was about half that a list that appeared on the money magazine site garnered 4 9 percent and barron s returned 5 3 percent one such list at cnbc did a little better than most at 10 6 percent but vanguard s total stock index fund returned 12 5 percent in the same period we even calculated these returns by assuming that any of the dividends were reinvested but still none beat the widely owned index fund there is nothing wrong with these lists if you are using them as mere suggestions of what companies might be worth investigating there were some bona fide winners on almost every list goldman sachs kennametal ellie mae douglas dynamics burlington stores you might not have heard of some of those companies so it s not a bad place to look for ideas but the problem with such lists is that they encourage people to approach investing the wrong way unsophisticated investors are being persuaded that they should own a sheaf of stocks but as you can see even when the stocks are recommended by professional money managers and filtered through some of the best financial journalists they don t do as well as the averages the best advice remains the same if you have money you want to play with go have some fun with a few stocks that you can monitor closely if you keep it simple it s easier to track and respond but for the rest of us the smart investment is those index funds they cost less than stocks or other funds they remove most of the emotion from your decision making which is the cause of a lot of bad decisions that s your best bet in 2017
